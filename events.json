It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 15, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4765688e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"683acb3d2e70494b979bc813a18b36a4","lat":"40.75655043125163","lng":"-111.9164673476162","__v":0}

She's toured with many of said artists as well as The Swell Season, Sara Bareilles, Amos Lee, Liz Phair, and more. Rachael was invited by the White House to take part in its Official White House 'Tweet Up' in the West Wing with fans, and was one of Chopra's music playlist selections featured on Oprah Winfrey's website.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nArtist/filmmaker/photographer Gregory Colbert, best known for his acclaimed project \"Ashes and Snow\" which, to date, is the most attended solo exhibition by any living artist in history, asked Rachael to be a guest vocalist on his upcoming project.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nRachael and John Medeski (Medeski Martin \u0026 Wood) covered director Robert Altman song 'Let's Begin Again' featured in the opening scene and end credits of the documentary, Altman (2014).

She's a natural jazz singer.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nFans span the spectrum from 14-year-old girls to 65-year-old men, from spiritual healers, helicopter pilots, and military women, to hostage negotiators, heads of television networks, and single mothers. Rachael continually hears from fans that her music helped them through something in their life. Famed Korean photographer Jungman Kim calls Rachael 'his muse' and writer/journalist/ broadcaster Katherine Lanpher cites Rachael as the only twice invited guest of the Barnes \u0026 Nobel series, \"Upstairs at the Square\" (with novelist Alaa-Al-Aswany, \"The Yacoubian Building\" and Bill Clegg, \"Portrait of an Addict as a Young Man\" and \"90 Days\").\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nOn the business front, Rachael was a guest speaker at 2013 Chicago Ideas Week, and profiled in two separate Topspin Berklee School of Music marketing classes with her Pledge Music DIY campaigns being used as part of the course curriculum.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nRachael breaks the mold of the singer/songwriter stereotype, and the DIY indie-artist model as, for the past four years she has be working without management representation.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nCD releases to date include Heavyweight EP (2012), Noisetrade Mixtape (2012), Chesapeake (2011), Elephants (2008), Loose Ends EP (2007), Live at the Loft (2005), Happenstance (2004), and Rachael Yamagata: EP (2001).\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nHer latest album, currently titled 'Tightrope Walker,' is slated for a fall 2015 release. It showcases her calling card ability to articulate humanity's struggles within relationships and the freedom that comes from celebrating that which we face alone and head on. The production is riskier and cinematic – think Tom Waits meets Roberta Flack, Nick Cave hanging with Rufus Wainwright. Rachael confounds a labeled genre and instead embraces the production that serves the story. The paradox of her art mirrors that of her career and proves that we are never simplistic, but always full of surprises.\r\n\r\nPressing Strings\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nPressing Strings is a soul stirring trio based out of the musically fertile scene of Annapolis, Maryland.

Presidents Circle","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Dan Forrest’s Utah Premiere of “Jubilate Deo” brings to life the global aspect of the traditional Psalm 100 text, “O be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands”.  Set in seven different languages, each movement combines some characteristics of its language-group’s musical culture with the composer’s own musical language. Texts include Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Zulu, Spanish, and English.\r\n\r\nThis moving work features Carol Ann Allred, soprano; Demaree Clayson Brown, alto; Wenjing She, erhu; John Yerby, guitar, SLCA Concert Choir, Women’s Choir, Vocal Artists, and the SLCA Chamber Orchestra.\r\n\r\n“Gospel Mass” opens the second half of the evening’s performance.  “It is my desire to combine centuries of old traditions of Mass settings with sounds of the contemporary Black Church.  The move from Latin to English created new opportunities for composers to express their feelings about the texts of the Ordinary of the Mass. I wanted everyone to experience the sense of joy and celebration that is generally felt in true African-American worship”, states Robert Ray the composer.  Ray composed the piece in 1978 while Ray was a liturgy team leader for the National Office of Black Catholics. \r\n\r\nMaking her first appearance at the Libby Gardner Concert Hall, Roseanna Clark is thrilled to be working with the Salt Lake Choral Artists as soloist. Joining her will be Carey Drisdom, bari/tenor; Laurel Hendricksen Palmer, piano; Mat Wennergren, guitar; Ben Johnson, bass and Mike Peck, drums.","date":"October 15, 2016","startTime":"19:30","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4765814e+12,"url":"http://tickets.utah.edu","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"f871584e85e14797bd29231e6b1a5f07","lat":"40.7662118","lng":"-111.8517333","__v":0}

Calhoun: High Places Make Me High","primCategory":"visual arts","primSubCategory":"galleries","secCategory":"","secSubCategory":"","locationName":"Sweet Branch","address":"455 F Street","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"My early desire to become a museum-quality artist guides me with an unwavering faith. With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together. Thanks so much for coming.","date":"October 15, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4765112e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5680/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"a2fb7432bac34d83b4cb7a7c7ca7363c","lat":"40.77989630311577","lng":"-111.87648869275452","__v":0}

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world?

Ballet West II was unveiled in 2004 and recently has toured the country to great success, this will be the first time they have had a dedicated program in Salt Lake City. The second company is comprised of pre-professionals from around the globe, and has been critically lauded for their physicality and diverse repertoire.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n“Ballet West II has established a reputation of its own as an elite touring ensemble,” said CEO and Artistic Director Adam Sklute. “The dancers are remarkably gifted; currently 25 dancers of Ballet West’s main Company have come out of Ballet West II including four of our Principals and five Soloists. Many others have gone on to dance with some of the most prestigious ballet companies in the world.” On a recent tour, the Cedar Rapids Gazette said, “Ballet West II’s eclectic program brought thrilling moments of the classical ballet tradition, as well as modern works by emerging choreographers and a little acid rock infused with plenty of attitude.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nSklute adds, “Director Calvin Kitten and Associate Director, Peggy Dolkas, have a deep and powerful knowledge of ballet and ballet training.” Kitten, a 19-year veteran of The Joffrey Ballet, has two Ruth Page Awards, and has been featured on the cover of Dance Magazine. He was Assistant Professor of Ballet at the University of Utah from 2010 to 2015. Dolkas was a beloved Soloist with Ballet West from 2003 to 2010. Prior to joining Ballet West II’s leadership staff, she was Ballet Mistress for Nevada Ballet Theater for three seasons. During their performing careers, both Kitten and Dolkas were named by Dance Magazine in their coveted list of “25 Dancers to Watch.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nAt the Rose Wagner, the troupe will perform a mixed bill of rarely seen classics and bold new works that will highlight the dancers impressive and diverse talents. The repertoire includes:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nEarly 19th Century Danish master August Bournonville’s Napoli Variations and Tarantella opens the program. This sunny, upbeat, and technically demanding piece showcases the strength, fast precise footwork, and charm of the entire Ballet West II troupe, and is a tribute to folk dances in Southern Italy.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBallet West II Associate Director Peggy Dolkas presents Are we there yet? A quirky and fascinating work that is set to a mix by DJ Robatroid for three couples. Dolkas has tooled this piece to feature the dancers’ unique fluidity and theatricality.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nMinkus Pas de Trois, with music from Ludwig Minkus, is a spellbinding re-staging after Marius Petipa’s ballet Paquita, originally choreographed in 1847. It is an elegant compilation for three dancers that shows off their pure and controlled classical technique and glamour.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nClosing the show is Ballet West Resident Choreographer Nicolo Fonte’s Piece of my Heart, a high-energy creation set to the music of Janis Joplin. The work unleashes the raw power and exuberance of Ballet West II’s young dancers with a rock and roll aesthetic.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBesides frequently presenting to sold-out audiences across the United States, Ballet West II also serves as a major component for Ballet West’s Outreach and Education initiatives.

As the grandson of renowned film composer John Williams, his style is different than one might expect\\. Instead of being thick and orchestral, his improvised bedroom recordings are akin to the dreamy lo\\-fi of acts of Deerhunter and Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti\\. Williams started recording his debut in the spring of 2010, playing all of the instruments himself and building washy textures through multi\\-tracking\\. Soon after the album was completed, he employed a full band to tour behind Lemniscate, which was released on No Pain in Pop in 2012\\. While in Seoul, South Korea, Lionel met up with Toro y Moi's Chaz Bundick and the two soon decided to collaborate, with 2014's Trance Zen Dental Spa being the result\\. Bundick signed Vinyl Williams to his Company Records, and released the space rock\\- and shoegaze\\-influenced Into during July of 2015\\. His next album was recorded by Bundick and featured guitar work by Ian Gibbs and additional vocals and synth by Medicine's Brad Laner\\. Released in August of 2016, Brunei reflected Williams' childhood fascination with that country's currency and his hopes for a more harmonious future\\.\r\nTickets: $8 ADV / $10 DOS","date":"October 16, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.476666e+12,"url":"http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=867088\u0026b=234786\u0026m=27601\u0026urllink=https%3a%2f%2fwww.ticketfly.com%2fpurchase%2fevent%2f1305031%2ftfly%3futm_medium%3dapi","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"e96da35fab6c410c9ddb26b2835df2e2","lat":"40.75312309301994","lng":"-111.90074602339905","__v":0}

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 16, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4766552e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"0f1ac30032cf4c55a23df833f845a924","lat":"40.756685195882774","lng":"-111.91645546834545","__v":0}

After his two previous studio albums (\"151a\" \u0026 \"Lighght\"), Kishi Bashi was at a musical impasse. “As I sat down to write songs last summer, I went to all my usual conduits of creation: violin loops, guitar, piano, and I came up with the musical equivalent of fumes”, says K Ishibashi. “I tried to create orchestral pop recordings that I assumed were my forte, and in turn I found myself standing in front of a creative wall of frightening heights.” \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAt this very same moment of musical uncertainty, K’s personal life was falling apart… He and his wife of 13 years had briefly separated and were struggling to keep their marriage together. In his own words, “Touring and its accompanying lifestyle took a heavy toll on my soul and my family”. As an outlet, K submerged himself in a new musical direction. \"Sonderlust\" emerged as a direct result of this personal struggle taking place at an artistic crossroads. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWith the help of producer Chris Taylor (Grizzly Bear), engineer Pat Dillet (Angelique Kidjo, David Byrne) and drummer Matt Chamberlain (Morrissey, Fiona Apple, of Montreal), Kishi Bashi has created his most personal and artistically adventurous work to date. “This album is straight from my soul. I questioned everything about what it means to love and desire. The difference between loving someone and being in love.”\r\n\r\nBusman's Holiday\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nBusman's Holiday is a two person band blending the melodic charm of lo-fi acoustics with the ecstatic showmanship of classic rock 'n' roll. The singer/songwriter duo is accompanied by a string section who fill out their complexly euphonic ballads of love, loss, lust and outer space. Born and raised in Bloomington, Indiana, the pair and their intrepid band of string playing companions have toured the U.S. and Canada extensively the past three years, recently appearing on Day Trotter and If You Make It's Pink Couch Sessions. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThough adept in a D.I.Y. aesthetic of acoustic busking with only a guitar and a suitcase drum set, the brothers are equally at home when sharing the stage with their three talented string players, who add a rich, layered musical texture to their unique songs of wanderlust and first love. Evoking a classic tent-show rock sound joined with the affable atmosphere of the assured vaudevillian, Busman's Holiday both charms and impresses with their own unique blend of humor and assured musical talent.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nThis event is 21 and over","date":"October 16, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.476666e+12,"url":"http://www.theurbanloungeslc.com/event/1246967-kishi-bashi-salt-lake-city/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"96da276baf9849bd93c3b4bae2e2c9cd","lat":"40.76380837280895","lng":"-111.87585957444342","__v":0}

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world?

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 17, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4767416e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"afced62c772e4c82a2866bfaa25b64e0","lat":"40.756681009043234","lng":"-111.9164219277516","__v":0}

They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together. Thanks so much for coming.","date":"October 16, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4765976e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5680/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"499b332b7b5145649e715a73ef5c380e","lat":"40.77989269925663","lng":"-111.87648202988717","__v":0}

Years later Bradford met Moses Archuleta and started jamming together. Other contributors to Deerhunter since its establishment in 2001 include Josh Fauver, Colin Mee and Whitney Petty. The current incarnation consists of Cox, Pundt and Archuleta plus bassist Josh Mckay and guitarist Frankie Broyles.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nDeerhunter's first album was a lo-fi experiment not initially intended for the wider world, but appeared in 2005 on a local Atlanta label, Stickfigure. Although officially untitled, it has since become known as Turn It Up, Faggot; a phrase that doesn't actually appear on the sleeve but is an insult that Cox claimed was often thrown at the band during their early gigs. Their next album, Cryptograms (2006), was generally considered to be their real debut and as such things started to get serious for the band. They had moved to fêted Chicago indie, Kranky (Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Low, Stars Of The Lid), and the world outside was starting to pay attention.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThen in mid-2008, Deerhunter and Kranky signed a deal with 4AD, allowing them to finally release music outside the US and the band's next move was to prove epic in more than just musical terms.?? Recorded over the course of a week at the Rare Book Studios in Brooklyn, NY, the Can and Wire-inspired Microcastle (2008) was to propel them to further heights. However, the album leaked four months before release, leading the band back to the studio to record Weird Era Cont., an album in its own right added as a bonus disc to make Microcastle a 25-track colossus. Not content with such prolificacy, the band announced a new five track EP, Rainwater Cassette Exchange, in 2009 and that its release would coincide with the band's extensive European, Japanese and Australian tour in May and June.??\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nDisplaying few signs of slowing down, Halcyon Digest, the band's fourth studio album was released in September 2010. Remaining in their native Georgia to piece together the album, Halcyon Digest took just a few weeks to complete. The recording sessions took place at Chase Park Transduction in Athens with Ben H. Allen helping to co-produce the album, while final track, 'He Would Have Laughed', was recorded separately by Bradford Cox at NOTOWN SOUND in Marietta. To announce the release, the band fully embraced the DIY mindset of their New Wave heroes from the 70's and 80's with a Cox-designed, cut-and-paste Xeroxed flyer. It's with these kind of approaches that Deerhunter continue to widen their sphere of influence and impress with each subsequent release.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAfter a brief hiatus, during which time Bradford Cox and Lockett Pundt released their own albums as Atlas Sound and Lotus Plaza respectively, a new Deerhunter line-up (with additions of bassist Josh Mckay and guitarist Frankie Broyles) reconvened in January 2013 at Rare Book Studio in Brooklyn, New York. Produced by Nicholas Vernhes and Bradford Cox and recorded in the dead of night, Deerhunter's new longplayer Monomania will be released in May. Monomania finds the group recalling its scrappy punk aesthetic; a perfect nocturnal garage rock album full of the layered and hazy vintage guitar sounds that define them.\r\n\r\nAldous Harding\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nAldous Harding's music is not for the faint of heart. Disarming in its desolate imagery and stark instrumentation, it deals with the raw materials of life: death, birth, grief and love. There are few happy endings, but the power is in how Harding enters into battle; with a dancer's grace and a boxer's stance.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nSometimes reminiscent of 60s-era folk singers Vashti Bunyan and Linda Perhacs, Harding's work lies in more harsh terrain than her forebears – piercing the long history of the genre with a grit and sincerity rarely encountered. Somewhat out of step with the 21st Century, Aldous' music is accompanied by wry wit and tenacious gall that will see her become a true stayer in the music world.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nHailing from New Zealand's Southern port town of Lyttelton, Aldous has received attention and accolades from some of the most illustrious corners of the music industry. Her self-titled debut album received 4 stars in MOJO and Uncut, while UK blog The 405 hailed her a \"toweringly talented song writer.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"Compelling, gothic-folk first from NZ newcomer.\" – UNCUT (four stars)\r\n___\r\n\"Soft chanting and singing saws add mystery to a beguiling debut.\" – MOJO (four stars)\r\n___\r\n\"Harding wrestles every last drop of macabre intent.\" – Silent Radio (10 out of 11)","date":"October 17, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.476756e+12,"url":"http://www.theurbanloungeslc.com/event/1255741-deerhunter-salt-lake-city/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"a14028f07a934078b0c8ecabb217b4ab","lat":"40.763750426833994","lng":"-111.87587504458254","__v":0}

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes.

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 18, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.476828e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"6349101e12764944938af90013b8382b","lat":"40.75665482583867","lng":"-111.91634867113001","__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5802ccd1f471130489134414"},"title":"Of Montreal + TEEN","primCategory":"community","primSubCategory":"teens","secCategory":"music","secSubCategory":"concert","locationName":"The Urban Lounge","address":"241 S 500 E","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"of Montreal\r\n\r\nWatch\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nInnocence Reaches begins with a query. “How do you identify?” coos a robotic voice over a strikingly modern mix of bright synthpop and surging rave. The question too feels very of its time—as outdated ideas about gender and attraction are being overturned—but it’s also a fair ask whenever of Montreal debuts an album.\r\n___\r\nThe project’s 14th LP follows two full decades of mercurial creative mania: swallowing up ‘60s psych-pop, Prince-ly funk, and glammy prog in turn; morphing freely between full-band affair and cloistered confessional booth; comprising lyrics both painfully personal and absurdly fantastical; and recently drawing site-specific inspiration from culture capitals like San Francisco or New York City. The thread that runs through it all is Athens, GA’s Kevin Barnes, and Innocence Reaches finds him at his most light-hearted in years, working a Parisian stint, Top 40 sounds, and his newfound single status into the kaleidoscopic swirl. Even as he continues to sift the sonic and emotional detritus of his past, Barnes sums up his current mood in the opener’s title: “let’s relate.”\r\n___\r\nThe most immediate surprise is the sound. Innocence Reaches is touched by contemporary electronica, indie pop, and EDM. For the first time in his career, Barnes tuned into now. “Forever I’ve been detached from current music,” he says. “I got into this bubble of only being in some other time period. I came up picking apart the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and symphonic pieces. But last year, I was hearing Jack Ü, Chairlift, Arca, and others, thinking about low end and sound collage. It was an extra layer to geek out on.”\r\n___\r\nParis helped with that. Barnes lived in a friend’s studio for two weeks. It was in an apartment complex and, as he prefers to work at night, he couldn’t thrash loud instruments for fear of noise complaints from the neighbors. But the in-house arsenal of vintage synthesizers and drum machines was fair game—check the skittering beats of “a sport and a pastime” and thick hum of “chap pilot.”\r\n___\r\nBy day, Barnes wandered Père Lachaise Cemetery, sat at cafés and wrote poems, read Jeans Ganet and Cocteau, or eavesdropped on conversations he couldn’t translate. “Being in that place where no one looks at me twice and I can’t even understand the language was like entering a parallel universe,” recalls Barnes. “It was cathartic and inspiring to amputate myself from my normal life and feel like an individual outside of all the baggage and memories.”\r\n___\r\nEnjoying anonymity, he sorted through the inner wreckage left by his divorce two years prior, and took stock of the briefer relationships since. “my fair lady” bids adieu to a familiar figure over sax-streaked disco-funk, but we soon meet Sarah from Detroit on darkwave dream “ambassador bridge,” and Gabrielle the Athenian Beach Goth amid the trappy space-glitch of “trashed Exes.” In “les chants de maldoror,” our hero cooly declares, “We only act nicely when we’re ruining hotel beds/I greeted you in a hundred doorways.” Innocence Reaches continues of Montreal’s recent autobiographical streak, which finds Barnes “fetishizing reality,” as he puts it.\r\n___\r\nBut he’s concerned with a broader reality as well. “it’s different for girls” is an exploration of the “dilemme féminin”. Combining Daft Punk’s aptitude for groove with LCD Soundsystem’s wit—an endlessly quotable track that has Barnes outlining the dangers inherent in binary gendering: “It’s different for girls,from when they are children they’re de-personalized, aggressively objectified...” and later Barnes sings “It’s different for girls, they are mercurial creatures, not a masculine dissonance or sexual currency”. The song is less feminine anthem and more pop exegesis of societal codes. “though some women are demons all of them are God”. Indeed.\r\n___\r\nApropos, Innocence Reaches’ cover design was an attempt by a new first-time father—Kevin’s brother David—to express his “wonderment for the female anatomy.” And the aforementioned “let’s relate” was indeed inspired by trans issues, a subject dear to Barnes’ heart. “I have a history of gender-bending in performances, but that’s also always been a part of my identity as a human,” he says. “I’m thankful to have an outlet for that, to express that and not get chased out of town or beat up. I think we’re moving in the right direction now.” The song is a call to find common ground in simply being human: “I like that you like you/I think that you’re great/I want to relate,” he sings cheerily.\r\n___\r\nInnocence Reaches features darker moments to be sure—isolation, anger, indifference, and the feeling that, like a Truffaut film, madness lurks just outside the frame—but as Barnes explains, “Epiphany comes from breakdown. If you can stay open and vulnerable, the nebulous becomes transparent. That’s one of the magical aspects of writing from personal life.”\r\n___\r\nSometimes you’ve gotta intentionally court a little chaos in order to make one of the best, weirdest, brightest, catchiest, and most inventive albums in your already incredible catalog.\r\n\r\nTEEN\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nTEEN's second album, 2014's The Way and Color, was a stunning creative breakthrough. Singer and multi-instrumentalist Teeny Lieberson's voice is starkly highlighted, but the whole record is a conversation between her; Katherine Lieberson's crafty, minimalist drumming; Boshra AlSaadi's lithe, sinuous bass lines; and Lizzie Lieberson's irresistible synth hooks. Now the group is back with its strongest release to date: the third full-length of their discography, Love Yes.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nBorn out of a creative process that included a dismal winter workshopping in Woodstock, a writing renaissance for lead-singer Teeny Lieberson in Kentucky, and a triumphant return to home in Nova Scotia to record, Love Yes is a lush, bold new creation that builds upon the group's previous efforts and takes off.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nOn the album cover, the quartet is bejeweled in crystals and bathed in Venusian red. This red is the color of vitality and pulsing life—unmistakable traits of Love Yes. It is the iconic red of Dorothy's slippers and Eve's apple—potent with society's tales and notions of innocence lost. In Love Yes, something else more mysterious and tender is gained.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nTEEN was founded in 2010 by lead-singer and multi-instrumentalist Teeny Lieberson (Here We Go Magic). She self-recorded and self-released the beguiling lo-fi Little Doods LP the following year, then formed a band that included sisters Katherine and Lizzie, and signed to Carpark for 2012's In Limbo. Produced by Sonic Boom (Spectrum, Spacemen 3), In Limbo encompasses everything in between sprawling, ethereal ballads and trancey but kinetic pop. Rolling Stone listed its opening track \"Better\" as one of the \"50 Best Songs of 2012.\" The Carolina EP followed in 2013 and was even more varied and accomplished; the band was growing by breathtaking leaps and bounds. TEEN's second full-length, The Way and Color, mixes the band's melodic psych with the sound of post-millennial R\u0026B. The LP has its share of darkness—fear, regret, and loss are all in the picture—but it's always redeemed by the sheer soulfulness and powerful ingenuity of the music. The album is a reflection on the aggressive times we live in, one that often lacks selflessness. TEEN's response is one that uplifts and brings a sense of happiness and joy. Love Yes continues this communication, this time exploring the disharmony and empowerment that both sexuality and spirituality can create within the modern woman's psyche. Universal ideas of loyalty, pleasure, purity, power, aging, and love are confronted with a knowable specificity. There is a quality of wholesomeness, but also an edge—a kind of wise anger and electricity.","date":"October 18, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4768424e+12,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/events/1207935965892622","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"6f421ee2153c49fa9b4e589142055058","lat":"40.763677944739115","lng":"-111.8757405341807","__v":0}

Calhoun: High Places Make Me High","primCategory":"visual arts","primSubCategory":"galleries","secCategory":"","secSubCategory":"","locationName":"Sweet Branch","address":"455 F Street","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"My early desire to become a museum-quality artist guides me with an unwavering faith. With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together. Thanks so much for coming.","date":"October 18, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4767704e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5680/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"7b3fd876b67c40eaafd32642c1331f92","lat":"40.779936848146555","lng":"-111.87644492177823","__v":0}

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 19, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4769144e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"25aa64b5146341e287716a51cbc74173","lat":"40.756719453441804","lng":"-111.91637507349853","__v":0}

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world? He lives in Salt Lake City.","date":"October 18, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4767704e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"93999b13122c45299cba62646400ee1f","lat":"40.780600995881485","lng":"-111.89921157611015","__v":0}

At once plainspoken and deeply literate, the band’s latest features nine new songs that capture the hopes and fears, the yearning and resignation, of a rootless, restless nation at a time of change. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nLife in the Dark also coincides with The Felice Brothers’ 10th anniversary as a band. Hailed by the AV Club for a sound at once “timeless, yet tossed-off,” they’ve released plenty of music over the past decade, often on their own without a record label, but the new album is the fullest realization yet of the band’s DIY tendencies. Self-produced by the musicians and engineered by James Felice (who also contributed accordion, keyboards and vocals), the Felice Brothers made Life in the Dark themselves in a garage on a farm in upstate New York, observed only by audience of poultry. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n“The recording is definitely rough around the edges and cheap,” James Felice says, laughing. “It was liberating and really cool to do. It allowed us to untether ourselves from anything and just make music.” \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBecause of makeshift studio set-up, the music they made was necessarily stripped down, emphasizing acoustic instruments and spacious arrangements on songs that showcase the sound of a band playing together live, with echoes in the music of Woody Guthrie, Townes Van Zandt, John Prine and rural blues.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n“We tried to make it as simple and folk-based as possible, because we were working with limited resources,” singer and guitarist Ian Felice says. “We wanted to take all the frills out and make it just meat and potatoes.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nStill, there are hints of seasoning: among the folk and blues touchstones, the band took a certain inspiration from Neil Young and the Meat Puppets, too. Ian Felice says he was trying to channel the spirit of Meat Puppets II on opener “Aerosol Ball” — “They played kind of weird, freaky folk music, so there’s a connection there,” he says — while James Felice says listening to Neil Young’s Tonight’s the Night was like getting permission to make Life in the Dark.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n“If you listen to that record, it’s fucking crazy,” he says. “We listened to that to know that what we were doing was legal and had precedent. If Neil Young could make a record that sounds like that, we can make a record that sounds like this.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nHe’s referring to the wild, whirling accordion and big, loose rhythm on “Aerosol Ball,” mournful glimmers of electric guitar and fiddle on “Triumph ’73” and the ramshackle, blues-rock feel of “Plunder,” full of grainy lead guitars, blasts of organ and a shout-along chorus inspired by the rhythm of Shakespeare’s “Double, double toil and trouble” incantation in Macbeth. Though The Felice Brothers often share songwriting duties, the band gravitated toward Ian Felice’s songs for Life in the Dark. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nAlong with Shakespeare and the Meat Puppets, Ian Felice absorbed the essence of writers from Anne Sexton to Anne Frank, Raymond Carver to Dr. Seuss, on tunes with clear, if unintentional, political undertones. “It’s just what was going on when I was writing the songs,” Ian Felice says. “It’s a pretty politically charged climate right now.” To say the least.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nThe singer’s characters on “Aerosol Ball” exist in a dystopian culture bought, and ruled, by corporations; while “Jack at the Asylum” catalogs cultural ills including climate change, economic inequality and the numbing aspects of televised warfare, themes that recur again on “Plunder.” He wrote the title track after re-reading The Diary of a Young Girl, the journal that Frank kept while in hiding from the Nazis during World War II. “The idea of living in a dark attic unable to fully grasp what is going on in your life and feeling powerless to change it seemed like a relevant metaphor for me at the time,” Ian Felice says.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nElsewhere, he offers his own interpretation of classic American archetypes: “Triumph ’73” follows a young man on the cusp of adulthood desperate to ride his motorcycle away from the life changes overtaking him, while the ballad “Diamond Bell” tells the story of a folk heroine gunslinger in the vein of Pretty Boy Floyd or Jesse James, and the hapless, lovestruck kid she ensnares. “It’s part-love song, part-adventure story, part-tragedy, told in the Mexican folk tradition of singing about bandits,” Ian Felice says. “I think it’s one of the most straight-ahead narratives I’ve written.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nThe band, also including Josh Rawson on bass and Greg Farley on fiddle, with drums by David Estabrook, spent about a month recording Life in the Dark in the late winter of 2015. James Felice learned engineering on the fly — “I literally had a book, like, ‘Where do you put the mic? How do you mic the kick drum?’” he says — and the band managed to nail most of the tunes within a few takes. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n“There wasn’t too much agonizing, just the joy of playing music,” James Felice says. “We had an audience of chickens, and an audience of each other, and we were just really enjoying making it.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nThe resulting album is more than just classic American music — it’s a parable for modern America.","date":"October 19, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4769288e+12,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/events/373236679680808","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"e6408c0ea2504a7eae54e789c5cf784e","lat":"40.763802257077515","lng":"-111.87574493430905","__v":0}

With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together.

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah.

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy.

The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location.

Fast forward to today, Bad Religion has become synonymous with intelligent and provocative West Coast punk rock and are considered one of the most influential and important bands in the genre. Over the past three decades the band has continually pushed social boundaries and questioned authority and beliefs armed only with propulsive guitars, charging drumbeats, thoughtful lyrics and an undying will to inspire and provoke anyone who will listen. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nBad Religion was a major force in reinvigorating the modern punk movement, produced beloved international hits such as \"Infected,\" \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\" and \"Sorrow\" and has maintained an impassioned worldwide following of young and old who continue embrace a music that gives voice to, and celebrates, their dissent. Cementing their place in history as a groundbreaking band who helped create a movement in Los Angeles with classic releases like How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, Suffer, Recipe for Hate, Stranger Than Fiction, Process of Belief, The Dissent of Man, and True North. Bad Religion continue to inspire and create with a unique style that continues to cross boundaries and transcends genres.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nBad Religion is:\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nBrett Gurewitz (vocals, guitar)\r\n___\r\nBrian Baker (guitar)\r\n___\r\nJamie Miller (drums)\r\n___\r\nGreg Graffin (vocals)\r\n___\r\nJay Bentley (bass)\r\n___\r\nMike Dimkich(guitar)\r\n\r\nAgainst Me!\r\n\r\nTwitter\r\n\r\nFacebook\r\n\r\nWebsite\r\n\r\nTo pirate the title of one of their early songs (and still a set-list staple), Against Me! is a band that laughs at danger and breaks all the rules.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nFronted by Laura Jane Grace, AM!'s much-anticipated latest offering, Transgender Dysphoria Blues, is scheduled for release in January 2014. The title of their sixth album offers a direct nod to news that shocked fans and shook up the rock world when it was dropped—Grace is a transitioning transgender person who revealed her story in the May 12, 2012 issue of Rolling Stone (readers curious to learn more about the transition can check out Laura Jane's \"My First Year as a Woman\" journal online in Cosmopolitan).\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nBecause Transgender Dysphoria Blues marks the band's first release with Grace as a woman, there are a lot of misconceptions: The record is neither a radical stylistic departure nor a \"concept album.\" Rather, it's just another bold step forward for an artist doing what she has always done—forging her own path by processing the highs and lows of life through music.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAgainst Me! began as an anarchist solo act in Gainesville, Florida in 1997. After transforming into a traditional four-piece a few years later with the crucial addition of guitarist James Bowman, they quickly became a driving force in the punk scene—despite facing an abundance of unsolicited danger.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWhile emerging unscathed from two separate road tour spinouts and, more recently, enduring a flying mic stand which cost Grace her front teeth, Against Me! have played in all 50 states and 29 countries, cranking out an average of 200 sweat-drenched, fist-pumping, shout-a-long live gigs per year over the past decade. Their music runs the gamut from thrashing to anthemic to intimate, with Grace's pointed lyrics and powerhouse voice blending vitriol and vulnerability like few other performers.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWith a healthy dose of folk and even some old-school country in their sound, the band's first three indie full-lengths (2002's Against Me! is Reinventing Axl Rose, 2003's As The Eternal Cowboy and 2005's Searching For A Former Clarity) earned them a rabid and steadily growing following.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nTheir 2007 major label debut, New Wave, was produced by Butch Vig (Nirvana, Garbage, Green Day) and named \"Album of the Year\" by SPIN Magazine. The early-Springsteen-esque raver \"Thrash Unreal\" reached #11 on the Modern Rock charts, and in addition to a headlining tour, the band also supported the Foo Fighters on the road in 2008.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAfter 2010's White Crosses (which peaked at #34 on the Billboard charts), the band parted ways with Sire. It was at this time that Grace went through an intense soul-searching phase and eventually decided to transition, going public with the gender dysphoria she had been dealing with since childhood.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAs might be expected with such an intensely personal project, Grace took complete creative control of Transgender Dysphoria Blues. She not only assumed producing reins for the first time but even built the Florida studio, Total Treble, where the demos were recorded. Then—more danger struck. During a tornado, a tree crashed through the roof of the studio.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAfter that mishap, the full record was recorded without further incident at three separate facilities: Dave Grohl's 606 Studios in Northridge, California; Motor Studios in San Francisco; and Earth Sounds in Valdosta, GA.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWhich is certainly not to say Transgender Dysphoria Blues is a \"safe\" record. Grace's soul is brutally laid bare here in this riveting 10-song collection. While four of the tracks directly address the unique anxieties and fears inherent with being transgender, they still crackle with universal resonance.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThe song \"Transgender Dysphoria Blues,\" written before Grace announced her transition, artfully folds the specter of hateful public perception (\"You want them to notice, the ragged ends of your summer dress… They just see a faggot.\") into an irresistible chugga-chugga arrangement, given ballast as always by Bowman's bouncing guitar and full-bore backing vocals.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThen there is the defiant battle cry of \"True Trans Soul Rebel\" (released in tandem with \"FUCKMYLIFE666\" on-line to fans through the Against Me! website in the Fall of 2013). Evoking fatalistic images of escape, the song ultimately showcases the strength both of Grace's spirit and voice, soaring mightily as it does when she asks the question \"Does god bless your transsexual heart?\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThe balance of the record covers typical Against Me! touchstones—from matters deeply personal (the sizzling \"Unconditional Love\"); to political (\"Osama Bin Laden as the Crucified Christ,\" which recalls Sandinista!-era Clash and the band's own \"From Her Lips To God's Ears (The Energizer)\") and even the music biz—\"Black Me Out\" is a flat-out showstopper, with Grace ramping a slow-burn into withering nuclear scorn, screaming at an unnamed power-abusing exec that she wants to \"chop those brass rings off your fat fucking fingers\" and \"piss on the walls of your house.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nJoining Grace and Bowman in the band are a brand-new rhythm section. Longtime bass player Andrew Seward amicably departed Against Me! in 2013 after 11 years with the band. Fat Mike of NOFX (also the owner of Motor Studios) handled bass duty on the recordings of \"FUCKMYLIFE666\" and \"Unconditional Love,\" while Laura Jane played on the album's other eight tracks.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nSince that time, Inge Johannson (formerly of Sweden's International Noise Conspiracy, and a surefire winner of the \"Scandinavian Ramones Lookalike Contest,\" if one is ever held) has come aboard as the full-time bassist.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThe new drummer is punk stalwart Atom Willard, who launched his career as a teenager with Rocket From the Crypt and has had stints with the Offspring, Angels \u0026 Airwaves, and Social Distortion. Willard replaced Jay Weinberg, who'd toured with the band since late 2010.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWith the lineup changes, Grace acknowledges that Against Me! may be in a state of flux, but the mission is still real: \"If I didn't feel like I had something that I really needed to say with the album we've been working on for the past year then I'd humbly hang the hat and move on,\" she said in the wake of Seward's departure.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n2013 saw another career milestone for Grace, as she co-wrote a song (\"Soulmates to Strangers\") with rock royalty Joan Jett for Jett's Unvarnished album. Against Me! is set to tour behind the new record in 2014 with an attitude perhaps best summed up by these lines from\"FUCKMYLIFE666\": \"No more troubled sleep. There's a brave new world raging inside of me.\"\r\n\r\nDave Hause\r\n\r\nTwitter\r\n\r\nFacebook\r\n\r\nWebsite\r\n\r\n\"The way we learned to live is fading fast/I guess we never bargained for a crash.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nFor Dave Hause the American dream is a broken promise, a childhood ideal that has been shattered by the reality of the past two decades. On the musician's second solo album, Devour, Hause scours the foundation of that crumbled dream in an attempt to discover how everything we believed growing up could have turned out so differently. The album, initially written to become the third record from Hause's rock band The Loved Ones, follows his 2011 solo debut Resolutions, a disc that allowed the musician to understand his potential as his own artist. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAs Hause, a Philadelphia native, began penning new music for a new album from The Loved Ones, it became clear that the group, who had taken a break after their second album, had stalled. These songs, however, which showcased a clear thematic journey, were meant to be vocalized by Hause and over the past few years he transformed them into Devour. Hause solidified the album's sequence before even going into the studio, aiming to craft a narrative arc that drove the album from its dark, heavy first half into a lighter, more hopeful tone. A thematic line of melody runs through the songs, reflecting the overarching ideas in the music itself. The disc explores the heartbreak of shattered childhood promises of a better world and concludes with optimistic hope. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"Devour is about that inherent American appetite,\" Hause says. \"It's in all the songs in some degree. There's a reason why Tony Soprano became such a huge American icon – he's this guy with this insane appetite for women and food and power. I think for the American public to latch onto a figure like that says something. Some of the positive things about America come from that as well, but there's a real sense of reckoning that comes from devouring everything in front of you. Is it ever enough?\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThe rock songs, tinged with folk and punk tones, are firmly rooted in Hause's own upbringing and the sensibility that comes from growing up in a blue collar neighborhood driven by the lingering anticipation of upward mobility. In the lyrics, the fulcrum around which the album revolves, Hause grapples with this working class ideal and the fact that America's recent shifts have caused it to no longer fit. From \"The Great Depression,\" which centers on the unfulfilled promises laid out in the Reagan-era '80s, to the more specific-minded relationships of \"Father's Son,\" Devour comes to terms with the loss of youthful innocence in a rapidly evolving world. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"I wanted to shine a light back on what was going on,\" Hause says. \"It was a topic that was close to me and I wanted to write about it. In the end, it leaves you with the idea that if you have music and love you may be able to save yourself. It's going to be alright. That simple John Lennon concept of all you need is love. That's how I wrote myself out of the dark and the music begs the listener to come take that risk as well.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nOnce Hause had the track sequence and overall narrative in place he enlisted producer Andrew Alekel along with musician and co-producer Mitchell Townsend. The producers helped Hause collect the right musicians to build the songs in the best way possible, including My Morning Jacket keyboardist Bo Koster, Social Distortion drummer David Hidalgo Jr. and bassist Bob Thomson. Frightened Rabbit's Scott Hutchison, Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba and The Watson Twins also appear on several tracks. Hause and his crew recorded the album over several weeks from mid-February to mid-March at Grandmaster Recorders LTD. in Hollywood, CA, focusing on giving each song the right tone while maintaining an overall musical aesthetic that helps tie the lyrical themes together. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"It was this group effort,\" Hause says. \"A lot of trust went into letting Andrew and Mitch be the architects of the record. I trusted that we would get in there and they would know who was right for the music. They wanted to bring these people together in this great studio to get a record that was greater than the sum of its parts. I'm glad I trusted them because it was great to work with everyone there.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nFor the musician, who has toured with Social Distortion, The Gaslight Anthem, Bouncing Souls and Chuck Ragan since launching his solo career, Devour is a cathartic release, both sonically and lyrically. Hause recently relocated to California and is committed to pursing the music he feels best reflects him individually. The journey on the album, the search for the light at the end of the tunnel, mirrors his own trek. The record closes with the delicate introspection of \"Benediction,\" a song that pulls lyrical lines from all the tracks that precede it.

In addition to their 2014 debut full- length, they’ve released three EPs, as well as a Christmas EP and a live album. They’ve performed on various television shows including VH1's “You Oughta Know Concert,” “The Tonight Show starring Jay Leno,” “Late Show with David Letterman,” “The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson,” “Today Show,” “Live with Kelly \u0026 Michael,” and provided the theme song on HGTV’s “Fixer Upper.” The duo has also toured extensively including major U.S. festival appearances. \r\n\r\nGeorgica Pond was produced by JOHNNYSWIM’s Abner Ramirez and recorded at the couple’s home studio in Los Angeles, with bass and drum parts added at the Castle in Nashville. \r\n\r\nOf their process, Ramirez explains, “Any fear we had on album one has completely evaporated. We know the people that come to JOHNNYSWIM shows. We know it matters to them what we have to say. We realize that, much like ourselves, our fans appreciate honesty. We wanted that to be the cornerstone of this album.” Amanda Sudano Ramirez further highlights the themes on the album: “love, legacy, the past and the future all put into this bittersweet mixture that makes you fully appreciate the present.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n21 and over","date":"October 21, 2016","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4771052e+12,"url":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1264615?utm_source=TSRsite","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"d0af6b553b1749aeb7a9c37625cf9d56","lat":"40.75519210293666","lng":"-111.88881298689088","__v":0}

Calhoun: High Places Make Me High","primCategory":"visual arts","primSubCategory":"galleries","secCategory":"","secSubCategory":"","locationName":"Sweet Branch","address":"455 F Street","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"My early desire to become a museum-quality artist guides me with an unwavering faith. With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together. Thanks so much for coming.","date":"October 20, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4769432e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5680/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"a847eb29f08d439e9f016b7dcee1f16b","lat":"40.78003187974615","lng":"-111.87658721745427","__v":0}

In *Cantando na chuva*,* *Reale is unrecognizable in a gold suit complete with a gold gas mask and a gold umbrella as she dances to the title song of the 1952 Hollywood classic *Singing in the Rain. *Dancing through a landfill among the *catadores*(pickers)* *who routinely sift through the piles of trash in the background, Reale presents a contrast** **between the backbreaking actions* *of the workers** **and the frivolous nature of a material-obsessed world.

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world? He lives in Salt Lake City.","date":"October 21, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4770296e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"a752749cadad419fbb62afe3f79ad3e6","lat":"40.78049887480844","lng":"-111.89914136092474","__v":0}

Calhoun: High Places Make Me High","primCategory":"visual arts","primSubCategory":"galleries","secCategory":"","secSubCategory":"","locationName":"Sweet Branch","address":"455 F Street","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"My early desire to become a museum-quality artist guides me with an unwavering faith. With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together. Thanks so much for coming.","date":"October 21, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4770296e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5680/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"8ea8ea599af343848fb381fea94e0089","lat":"40.77985719260787","lng":"-111.8765091389987","__v":0}

Be the LEAD SINGER of a Live Band with This Is Your Band (TIYB), playing here every Thursday night!  This IS the ONLY Live Band Karaoke in Utah...and once you experience it, you'll never look at Karaoke the same!  They have over 1000 songs to choose from - to view their list, go to thisisyourband.com and download their songlist!  Arrive early to get on the list...it fills up fast and we want to hear YOU sing!  Come early and enjoy one of our delicious dinner entrees and your favorite beverages all night long!  This event is SOOOOO popular that the LIST fills up fast, and we want as many of you to be able to sing every Thursday as possible, so please review the following so we can get as many of you up on stage as possible and to avoid any confusion:   1. You must sign up on the list with our KJ - Paul Woody (PDub). He is the ONLY person that can sign people up to sing. Watch for him to arrive and get your name on the list.  2. You must ALREADY have your song picked out when you ask Paul to sign you up - NO EXCEPTIONS.   3. Paul will announce 3 singers at a time: UP NEXT, ON DECK, and IN THE HOLE. When you are in the ON DECK position, you need to be at the stage BEFORE the current singer completes their song so you can go right up. We need you ready to go when it is your turn to avoid delays which takes singing time away. If you ARE NOT ready to take stage when it is your turn, you will lose your turn and will need ask to get back on the list (at the bottom). NO EXCEPTIONS!  3. DO NOT ask to be bumped up on the list - it will not happen. It is not fair to other singers who have been waiting their turn.  4. If you want to be put on the list again after you have sang, you can sign up immediately after completing your song ONLY.  5. A duet counts as one person's song. If a singer invites you up to sing a duet with them, that WILL NOT count as YOUR song, and you will keep your current place on the list.    It is BEST to arrive early to get your name on the list and get up as quickly as possible. That MAY improve your chance to sing again later in the evening, but is NOT a guarantee.","date":"October 20, 2016","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4770188e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"47c6660e3f524c3386aa48f5db6e06a7","lat":"40.586740357133415","lng":"-111.89562623359613","__v":0}

The two talked and hung out for a while and decided they had the same dream: To find a drummer, change the world, and make amazing music. In that awkward and ever so memorable process, they met the small but hilariously funny and ravishing young specimen that is Gavin Cox, who said he knew how to play drums. In a very quick exchange of words they decided to meet at Brenden's house to rehearse. On a common after-school day, Gavin and Brantly both showed up with guitars in hand, and Brenden just showed up. After about ten minutes, to Brenden and Brantlys' astonishment, they found out that Gavin had no friggin idea how to play the drums...at all. So considering the fact that he was the best looking of the three of them, they could not get rid of him. So instead of kicking Gavin out, they gave him a bass guitar, Brenden swapped to drums, Brantly never changed, and Melting Rain was born. The line-up has been consistent since then with slight changes between the three moving from drums to bass to guitar.

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location.

Several of the duo's friends within the Portland, Oregon music scene had been playing \"The 20-Song Game.\" The rules were simple, playful and ambitious: Songwriters would arrive in their studios at prearranged times and spend all day recording 20 complete songs. When they were finished, they'd have a party, listen to the results and talk about the process—of taking the good with the bad, of letting creativity push past constraint, of simply making music in the moment. Brandon Summers and Benjamin Weikel took the spirit of the \"The 20-Song Game\" to heart, and forged ahead writing a new record.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"Negotiations was a very long, introspective process,\" remembers Summers of the band's 2012 Sub Pop LP. \"We shut ourselves off from the world and disappeared down the rabbit hole. That's how we tend to work, but we wanted to try something new, open and immediate.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn a sense, The Helio Sequence had spent their whole career preparing for this record. They'd sunk entire recording advances into studio purchases, collaborating with local engineers to build custom gear and a space where they could blend high fidelity with kaleidoscopic sound. In 2013, the pair took on their first full-scale production project, the Brazilian rock band Quarto Negro, after the group inquired about their space and availability through Facebook. As producers, they'd remixed Shabazz Palaces, picked up mixing sessions with Portland acts and earned representation from Global Positioning Services. Summers and Weikel discovered just how adaptable and powerful their studio could be.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn May of 2014, inspired by the \"20-Song Game\", they began arriving each morning in their Portland space—housed in the cafeteria and break room of an old warehouse— with the mission of making as much music as possible in one month. They began exploring and capturing, recording guitar riffs and keyboard loops, drum patterns and bass lines. One piece documented, they quickly advanced to the next idea. Summers and Weikel didn't discuss what they were making or the reference points that informed it, though such discussions had once been central to The Helio Sequence's more self-conscious process. They just played. Created. In time, they returned to each fragment, broadcasting it over the studio PA, jamming and recording the results. Mistakes didn't matter, and second chances didn't exist. After two weeks, Summers and Weikel began cutting those loose takes into rough shapes, steadily building songs from their cavalier sketches.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAlthough making records can be a laborious and tedious process, Summers delights in the memory of making this one.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"We were coming to the studio on these sunny mornings everyday with an open mind,\" Summers shares. \"We said, 'I'm just going to do what feels good in the moment.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"We worked so quickly that there was a running optimism,\" he continues. \"There's this sense of striving for perfection where you can actually take momentum away. But we wanted this record to be momentum in and of itself.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWhen June arrived, the duo gathered their 26 finished songs and sent them to 31 friends, fans and family members. They asked each person to rank their 10 favorite tracks. By summer's end, they had arrived at the brisk 10 tracks that shape the breathless and magnetic The Helio Sequence—a record so named because it's a kind of clean restart for the longtime pair, a revamp of their process and a revitalization of their results.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThe Helio Sequence is a renewed push forward for the band: From the cool wallop of \"Deuces,\" where guitars snarl and harmonies soar, to the stuttering anxiety of \"Upward Mobility\", where pianos pound and drums race, this collection depends upon an effortless kinetic energy. Lyrically, \"Stoic Resemblance\" is a study of existential anxiety, but musically, it's a beguiling burst of pop, Summers' vocals rising over and sliding off of Weikel's big, irrepressible beat. The bittersweet \"Leave or Be Yours\" evokes the easy twinkle of romance and the smoldering sadness of losing it. Crisscrossing vocals and cross-talking guitars and drums map a broad swirl of emotions.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWith its easy acoustic jangle, \"Inconsequential Ties\" might be one of the most surprising, light moments within the bombastic Helio Sequence catalog. But considered within the band's history, it points to the pop that's bound Summers and Weikel for so long. Indeed, there's a delightful candor to The Helio Sequence, an openness that is a rare and special feat for a band about to enter its third decade.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"It's less about curating yourself or trying to put yourself across how you want to be perceived,\" says Summers. \"It's about having a conversation with people and giving them something that's who you are.\"\r\n\r\nGenders\r\n\r\nTwitter\r\n\r\nFacebook\r\n\r\nWebsite\r\n\r\nThe members of Portland's Genders had already closed the book on their previous band by the time they received the news that it had been voted one of the city's best new acts. Seemingly, this was just the motivation they needed to accelerate through the tiresome early stages of establishing their new project. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nNow - four years and countless road hours later, including a full national tour opening for Built To Spill - the gang of four is preparing for their sixth release with the kind of confidence that can only be gained from experience. Phone Home features five new reverb-drenched rockers that take a slightly different approach than the band's previous adventures with dream pop; the new bunch sounding more like a nightmare than any kind of dream.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThe first glimpse of this is the sarcastically titled Life Is But A Dream, in which singer/guitarist Maggie Morris addresses a recent heartbreak through gritted teeth as she tunefully laments over dreamy guitars and a relaxed yet compelling groove.","date":"October 20, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4770152e+12,"url":"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1302035-helio-sequence-salt-lake-city/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"45d54019b2ac4733b43682f09281f791","lat":"40.76689800046136","lng":"-111.90894864410149","__v":0}

A Northwest indie hero, Blau channels darkness and hope in a cinematic collection of Nashville country hits from the 60's and 70's. Produced by Tucker Martine, the record features performances by Jim James (My Morning Jacket), Laura Veirs, Jon Hyde, Eli Moore (Lake), Steve Moore (Earth, SunnO)))), among others.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIt all started with cutting a 7\" single, a cover of the 1969 Tom T. Hall hit \"That's How I Got to Memphis\". Blau, whom Martine had come to know from sessions with Laura Veirs among others, asked if he could try singing it. \"I knew what a special artist Karl was, but I had no idea what a powerful interpreter of songs he was,' Martine says. The collaboration, pairing Blau's deeply sonorous voice with Martine's warm, modern arrangements, recast the Nashville hit in a new light. \"He was able to communicate the essence of the song in such a moving way that we started dreaming of making a whole record based around our excitement for that collaboration.\" The result was the single and, now, Introducing Karl Blau.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nMartine and Blau worked for years on shaping the narrative of the record. \"I feel like I am starring in this country-western movie, written and produced by Tucker, and it tells a story,\" says Blau. A sense of emergence from the shadows of loss, loneliness, infidelity, and melancholy runs through Introducing Karl Blau. \"We've threaded a story through the record,\" says Blau. \"My character is moving through this dark place, but there is always this light of hope.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThe record, all covers, is a crate-digger's feast of forgotten hits and deeper cuts; most of them from the Nashville country-soul renaissance in the late 1960s and early 70s – Tom T. Hall, Bobby Bond, Allen Reynolds. Other songs are from the Bee Gees (To Love Somebody), Link Wray (Fallin' Rain), or Townes Van Zandt (If I Needed You). The project was a labour of love for Martine, the son of a Nashville songwriter who grew up listening to many of these songs.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAs for the title, Introducing Karl Blau, Martine says \"In spite of Karl's prolific catalog of records I still feel that not nearly enough people have had the opportunity to hear this man. With any luck this album will help change that.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nKarl Blau is a multi-instrumentalist, singer, and DIY icon who helped turn his hometown of Anacortes, Washington, into an indie-music mecca. He has released more than 40 records in 20-odd years, many self-released in handmade packaging and mailed to subscribers, and others on iconic indie Northwest labels K and knw-yr-own. Blau has also toured and recorded for years with Laura Veirs, the Microphones, Little Wings, D+, and Earth.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nTucker Martine, known for his distinctive production work on music by My Morning Jacket, the Decemberists, and Laura Veirs, was first introduced to Blau's early music by Veirs. \"I was transfixed by Karl's voice and completely absorbed by the world of sound he had created. I felt like I had been shown one of the great hidden treasures of music.\"\r\n\r\nLAKE\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nLAKE formed in Olympia, WA in 2005.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nMembers include Ashley Eriksson, Eli Moore, Markly Morrison, and Andrew Dorsett. Past members or collaborators include Lindsay Schief, Adam Oelsner, Paul Adam Benson, Micah Davis-Wheeler, Kenny Tarantino, and Karl Blau. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nTheir first album is self-titled, Lake, but is also known as Lake at the Department of Safety. Karl Blau recorded and produced this record at the local firehouse-turned artist-in-residence and creative space, Department of Safety in his hometown of Anacortes, WA. The sound of the album borrows from the band's wide influences of folk, bossa-nova, soft-rock, and Maher Shalal Hashbaz.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nLAKE's next release, Cassette, was home-recorded in Olympia with help from Portland band, Typhoon. These recordings were originally demos were intended for a recording session with producer, Tucker Martine, but the recordings turned out so great, the band self-released it as a cassette e.p. Over the course of the next two years, LAKE recorded sporadically with Tucker at his home studio in Portland, but the final product has been put in the vaults for now, waiting to be released. Cassette was eventually turned into a full-length album with additional songs from the sessions, through Funkytonk.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nNext the band speed-recorded and self-released a dancy, up-beat album, Oh, The Places We'll Go. While touring their album in Europe, the band got word that K Records was interested in releasing Oh, The Places We'll Go, thus would begin their relationship to release the next three albums, Let's Build A Roof, Giving and Receiving, and The World is Real .\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn 2009 LAKE entered Dub Narcotic Studio at K Records to record another album with Karl Blau a, Let's Build A Roof. Following the album's release, the band toured with Karl in the US and Europe for the \"Let's Build a Zebra\" tour. Recorded by Calvin Johnson at Dub Narcotic, and mixed by Karl Blau, Giving and Receiving was laid to tape which began to disintegrate, and in effort to save the fruits of their labor, it was transferred to digital, a first for LAKE.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn the fall of 2012 Ashley and Eli toured Japan, where they began selling a cassette called Avocado, compiled of outtakes and alternate cuts of songs spanning their career. It contained an alternate version of \"Christmas Island\" which originally appeared on Let's Build A Roof, and is featured on the Cartoon Network show Adventure Time.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn 2013, LAKE released The World is Real, on K-Records. Recorded with the help of Ben Hargett, the album is the last with founding member Lindsay Schief. A short time later, the band recorded yet another album with Karl Blau, in Anacortes, at the Unknown studio. Circular Doorway was also released in 2013.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nLAKE has a rich history of collaboration and have toured extensively throughout the U.S., Europe, and Japan with Laura Veirs, Adrian Orange, Half-handed Cloud, Ages \u0026 Ages, Desolation Wilderness, Karl Blau, Ever-ending Kicks, Wye Oak, 4 Bonjour Parties, and R.

In *Cantando na chuva*,* *Reale is unrecognizable in a gold suit complete with a gold gas mask and a gold umbrella as she dances to the title song of the 1952 Hollywood classic *Singing in the Rain. *Dancing through a landfill among the *catadores*(pickers)* *who routinely sift through the piles of trash in the background, Reale presents a contrast** **between the backbreaking actions* *of the workers** **and the frivolous nature of a material-obsessed world.

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world?

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 21, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4770872e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"16c0658c5f1440e09a4261b9c6babb14","lat":"40.756675944859055","lng":"-111.91639530511321","__v":0}
