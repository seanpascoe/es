Be the LEAD SINGER of a Live Band with This Is Your Band (TIYB), playing here every Thursday night!  This IS the ONLY Live Band Karaoke in Utah...and once you experience it, you'll never look at Karaoke the same!  They have over 1000 songs to choose from - to view their list, go to thisisyourband.com and download their songlist!  Arrive early to get on the list...it fills up fast and we want to hear YOU sing!  Come early and enjoy one of our delicious dinner entrees and your favorite beverages all night long!  This event is SOOOOO popular that the LIST fills up fast, and we want as many of you to be able to sing every Thursday as possible, so please review the following so we can get as many of you up on stage as possible and to avoid any confusion:   1. You must sign up on the list with our KJ - Paul Woody (PDub). He is the ONLY person that can sign people up to sing. Watch for him to arrive and get your name on the list.  2. You must ALREADY have your song picked out when you ask Paul to sign you up - NO EXCEPTIONS.   3. Paul will announce 3 singers at a time: UP NEXT, ON DECK, and IN THE HOLE. When you are in the ON DECK position, you need to be at the stage BEFORE the current singer completes their song so you can go right up. We need you ready to go when it is your turn to avoid delays which takes singing time away. If you ARE NOT ready to take stage when it is your turn, you will lose your turn and will need ask to get back on the list (at the bottom). NO EXCEPTIONS!  3. DO NOT ask to be bumped up on the list - it will not happen. It is not fair to other singers who have been waiting their turn.  4. If you want to be put on the list again after you have sang, you can sign up immediately after completing your song ONLY.  5. A duet counts as one person's song. If a singer invites you up to sing a duet with them, that WILL NOT count as YOUR song, and you will keep your current place on the list.    It is BEST to arrive early to get your name on the list and get up as quickly as possible. That MAY improve your chance to sing again later in the evening, but is NOT a guarantee.","date":"December 1, 2016","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4806512e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"e20f7897b60b4ca78ecc262902c721bd","lat":40.586803183753055,"lng":-111.89552797188243,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 1, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4805756e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"62642774cfa54eac8d636c47efb3a67e","lat":40.7683089174466,"lng":-111.8946524156018,"active":true,"__v":0}

Nature, wildlife, and action shots are his favorites. He loves the challenge that arises from the unpredictability of his subjects when he is trying to capture the perfect wildlife moment. He is a native of California but moved to Salt Lake City in July 2013. Mr. Marto grew up in Carmel Valley, CA, so it is no surprise that he gravitated towards wildlife photography. Mountain biking, hiking, tennis, and playing the electric guitar round out the list of pursuits for this U.C. San Diego graduate.

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"December 1, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4805756e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"0b07639946254f92a827ee57f9a1371e","lat":40.780607054697064,"lng":-111.89919401311552,"active":true,"__v":0}

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species. My wish is that through my photos, I can help others to appreciate Morocco’s geographic, human, and artistic beauty as well as its rich heritage.","date":"December 1, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4805756e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5923/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"f88764e010f649afa117a01a885ee0de","lat":40.72462390708858,"lng":-111.85931272505658,"active":true,"__v":0}

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 1, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4805756e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"44865511fe214bd48904cc6e6651ca11","lat":40.769619262815674,"lng":-111.87353984357485,"active":true,"__v":0}

The clucking chickens and drying laundry are somewhat unusual genre elements for the artist, and along with the flawlessly blue sky draw the viewing into one of the most captivating images Stewart ever painted.

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 2, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.480662e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"c224e6b187504830a00f67ab33a8e799","lat":40.768418263876974,"lng":-111.89468398051079,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"December 2, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.480662e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"6443eb0301924b85bbd0ff9319ded4ea","lat":40.78057532507314,"lng":-111.89912366463601,"active":true,"__v":0}

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species.

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 2, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.480662e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"c3ad48e856154ccca0619a36c83ab804","lat":40.76976521366667,"lng":-111.87336744259049,"active":true,"__v":0}

Rio Grande Street","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"The Winter Market at Rio Grande, a project of Urban Food Connections of Utah,  will return to downtown on November 5th at the Rio Grande Depot (300 S Rio Grande St). With more than 60 local vendors (listed at slcfarmersmarket.org) the market is held alternating Saturdays, through April 22, 2017, from 10 AM - 2 PM.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nDue to warm autumn weather conditions, an abundant harvest of produce will be available at the market. Shoppers can expect many items suitable for upcoming holiday meals such as squash, onions, potatoes, carrots, beets, and several varieties of greens.\r\n\r\nFor the first time at Winter Market, fresh locally-raised turkeys will be available for purchase on site. Also available is a wide array of other local and specialty products, including grass-fed meats, specialty cheeses, 100% wild and sustainable seafood, honey, jam, salsa, spreads and more. This diverse range of products includes baked goods and six local natural meat purveyors featuring beef, lamb, pork and eggs.\r\n\r\n\"The fourth season of the Winter Market at Rio Grande opens with a record number of vendors, \" said market director Alison Einerson. We're proud to offer the most diverse product mix seen in any previous years, and I am proud to say this is the best place to source locally raised and grown food throughout the winter.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the products available are unique to the Winter Market; the same is true for non-food products as well. Hosting a Winter Market at the Rio Grande Depot also offers an opportunity to provide additional exposure for the programs and resources found at the Rio Grande Depot, which are overseen by the Utah Department of Heritage and Arts. These include the Rio Gallery and The Utah Division of State History. The Statewide Annual exhibit rotates between Mixed Media \u0026 Works on Paper; Craft, Photography, Video \u0026 Digital works; and Painting \u0026 Sculpture: a preview of the upcoming show will be on display at the first market. \r\n\r\n**Vendor List:**\r\n\r\nVendor\r\n\r\nAbigail's Oven\r\n\r\nAmour Spreads\r\n\r\nAsian \u0026 Heirlooms\r\n\r\nBackyard Urban Garden (B.U.G.)

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 3, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4807484e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"e51ce383972444ec83868e18797cec07","lat":40.76836611278661,"lng":-111.89455368063021,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"December 3, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4807484e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"ca2e12a621e54d72b14ff2457b90c025","lat":40.780531643654946,"lng":-111.89913015326559,"active":true,"__v":0}

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species. My wish is that through my photos, I can help others to appreciate Morocco’s geographic, human, and artistic beauty as well as its rich heritage.","date":"December 3, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4807484e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5923/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"8e8a8f9122c040a384ca26ca1f5016a0","lat":40.724612837254966,"lng":-111.85932960351278,"active":true,"__v":0}

Nature, wildlife, and action shots are his favorites. He loves the challenge that arises from the unpredictability of his subjects when he is trying to capture the perfect wildlife moment. He is a native of California but moved to Salt Lake City in July 2013. Mr. Marto grew up in Carmel Valley, CA, so it is no surprise that he gravitated towards wildlife photography. Mountain biking, hiking, tennis, and playing the electric guitar round out the list of pursuits for this U.C. San Diego graduate. He has a beautiful wife and two adorable children.\r\n\r\nPaul’s work has recently been highlighted by *National Geographic*, *USA Today*, *KSL.com*, *Utah.com*, Bolsa Chica Conservancy, Sea \u0026 Sage Audubon Society, The Environmental Nature Center, *Orange County Register*, *Irvine World News*, *Focusingonwildlife.com*, and *WildlifePhotographyNews.net*. He is a recent winner of the City of Irvine's 40th Anniversary Photo Contest and his works have won numerous online photo contests as well.

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"December 5, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4809212e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"1f6b76c260f748da87b1524702996e1a","lat":40.78055920302072,"lng":-111.89913669870049,"active":true,"__v":0}

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species. My wish is that through my photos, I can help others to appreciate Morocco’s geographic, human, and artistic beauty as well as its rich heritage.","date":"December 5, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4809212e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5923/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"2e20131bb0f947d58d155f8cb19222dc","lat":40.72454812112589,"lng":-111.8592567240247,"active":true,"__v":0}

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting.

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 6, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4810076e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"0a40fa71aaeb458f939bfa7a20d5cdfe","lat":40.768370759154166,"lng":-111.89462979658917,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"December 6, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4810076e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"e272bc51033149e08abb94118db97580","lat":40.78056177178371,"lng":-111.89914683045,"active":true,"__v":0}

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species. My wish is that through my photos, I can help others to appreciate Morocco’s geographic, human, and artistic beauty as well as its rich heritage.","date":"December 6, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4810076e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5923/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"01ff3e195f4b4b2f819fe9d15903b1d1","lat":40.7245778594887,"lng":-111.85932880891413,"active":true,"__v":0}

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 6, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4810076e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"497b59e93c334363988b1495b88b2e84","lat":40.76963774848424,"lng":-111.87338329061983,"active":true,"__v":0}

It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level.

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 2, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.480662e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"e286d5d5d38f437abca099e64e25165c","lat":40.76968650655589,"lng":-111.87346666229405,"active":true,"__v":0}

It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 5, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4809212e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"fd7a3ba5c6be4e56af1dd69a3ec07605","lat":40.769794305158854,"lng":-111.87340516934653,"active":true,"__v":0}

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 6, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4810076e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"4d1abefecfd842288ece089bcceff1d4","lat":40.76971921342353,"lng":-111.8734579105851,"active":true,"__v":0}

Using intimate depictions and visual stories, I bring these experiences forward for examination. In addition to my observations, the investigation of scientific processes and origins informs the work and often becomes part of the visual. The idea of capturing an experience and inviting participation continues to be a focus.\r\n\r\nThe significance of a small moment of time lies in the detail and its depiction. What may be seemingly inconsequential can actually signify determination and will to survive. Phenomena that happen in nature inspire me to make work that emulates this experience. I want to tell of it. The interpretation of these events and the process of collecting, combining, and creating representations of these events expands on a direction from my earlier work. I explore the cause and effect using little glimpses of time and concentrate on the small occurrence such as a memory ring from a raindrop in a water puddle or a single leaf fluttering in the wind.\r\n\r\nContrasts in content that appear in nature are made evident by texture, color, complexity, and light or dark. By the action and reaction of these elements, I present my perceptions—sharing my sense of wonder with the viewer.\r\n\r\n**DESCRIPTION OF WORK**\r\n___\r\nMulti-media constructions and artist books narrate and illustrate these natural occurrences. Handmade papers, photography, pastels, pencils, wood, fabric, and other plant materials combine into two- and three-dimensional works. Many stand alone as interpretations of single moments, while others share common themes or ideas. Sometimes they form a series of events that sequentially describing the phenomenon.\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nLisa Anderson returns to the region to pursue her own studio practice after years of teaching as an Associate Professor at the University of South Carolina and the University of Saint Francis in Indiana. She earned her MFA from the University of Idaho and her BA from Idaho State University.\r\n\r\nExhibited both nationally and internationally, Anderson’s work consists of a wide range of media, including papermaking, book and paper constructions, traditional and digital drawing and painting, conceptual experiential work, illustration, and graphic design.\r\n\r\nAnderson’s academic career includes the establishment of a graphic design program, an art student organization, and the launch of international and domestic travel and study opportunities. As lead author of a self-study, Professor Anderson facilitated her department’s accreditation through the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). Anderson was a frequent presenter at the annual Southeastern College Art Conference, where she also exhibited works on paper and handmade artist’s books. She received the Bank of America Excellence in Teaching and Advising Award and was regularly honored with grants to fund a variety of research and artistic projects.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her academic career, she has extensive experience as a full-time and freelance graphic designer. She continues her freelance design career serving small and large businesses, musicians, filmmakers, and arts and cultural organizations.","date":"December 7, 2016","startTime":"20:30","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4811678e+12,"url":"http://slcpl.org/events/view/4692","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"7d630c2e6a9744eb9a860d5dd8a3241a","lat":40.760018524768135,"lng":-111.8849094752945,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 7, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.481094e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"a0575a113a7b497f964a13f903c437a6","lat":40.76838878758501,"lng":-111.89470884090116,"active":true,"__v":0}

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species.

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"December 7, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.481094e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"9fa6f2f8fd3b4334a1e59f5331cb03b9","lat":40.78062134898312,"lng":-111.89916095110884,"active":true,"__v":0}

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 7, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.481094e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"dc006efc31e845de8ab25c928b69114e","lat":40.76965784919003,"lng":-111.87352062877399,"active":true,"__v":0}

Tchaikovsky’s moving score, magical costumes, brilliant choreography, and fairytale sets combine to create a visually stunning production of *The Nutcracker*; underlining why *The New York Times’*principal dance critic called Ballet West’s *The Nutcracker*, “one of the best productions I’ve ever seen.”\r\n___\r\n \r\n___\r\nBallet West’s 61st Season of *The Nutcracker* will be a retirement party—of sorts—for the longest running production in America. In what is being billed as an ‘end of an era,’ Ballet West will retire the current physical production at the end of December to make way for new sets, costumes, and special effects in 2017. Willam Christensen’s iconic choreography and Tchaikovsky’s score will return in the new production completely intact and with no changes. This will be the fifth incarnation of Willam Christensen’s *The Nutcracker* production, and the first without his oversight. While in remarkably good condition, (due to constant, and costly upkeep), the current sets and many costumes are from an update almost 30 years ago.  \r\n___\r\n \r\n___\r\nTo celebrate the history of *The Nutcracker* and give audiences a glimpse at the future production, the Company is curating “Nutcracker Memories,” a free exhibit that will take over the Capitol Room in the Jessie Eccles Quinney Ballet Centre.

Be the LEAD SINGER of a Live Band with This Is Your Band (TIYB), playing here every Thursday night!  This IS the ONLY Live Band Karaoke in Utah...and once you experience it, you'll never look at Karaoke the same!  They have over 1000 songs to choose from - to view their list, go to thisisyourband.com and download their songlist!  Arrive early to get on the list...it fills up fast and we want to hear YOU sing!  Come early and enjoy one of our delicious dinner entrees and your favorite beverages all night long!  This event is SOOOOO popular that the LIST fills up fast, and we want as many of you to be able to sing every Thursday as possible, so please review the following so we can get as many of you up on stage as possible and to avoid any confusion:   1. You must sign up on the list with our KJ - Paul Woody (PDub). He is the ONLY person that can sign people up to sing. Watch for him to arrive and get your name on the list.  2. You must ALREADY have your song picked out when you ask Paul to sign you up - NO EXCEPTIONS.   3. Paul will announce 3 singers at a time: UP NEXT, ON DECK, and IN THE HOLE. When you are in the ON DECK position, you need to be at the stage BEFORE the current singer completes their song so you can go right up. We need you ready to go when it is your turn to avoid delays which takes singing time away. If you ARE NOT ready to take stage when it is your turn, you will lose your turn and will need ask to get back on the list (at the bottom). NO EXCEPTIONS!  3. DO NOT ask to be bumped up on the list - it will not happen. It is not fair to other singers who have been waiting their turn.  4. If you want to be put on the list again after you have sang, you can sign up immediately after completing your song ONLY.  5. A duet counts as one person's song. If a singer invites you up to sing a duet with them, that WILL NOT count as YOUR song, and you will keep your current place on the list.    It is BEST to arrive early to get your name on the list and get up as quickly as possible. That MAY improve your chance to sing again later in the evening, but is NOT a guarantee.","date":"December 8, 2016","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.481256e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"ef9b63279a9f4f9c9e1c6e76a59d547e","lat":40.58674700649287,"lng":-111.89561163241865,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 8, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4811804e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"f39bfbc2c7f548829b6ce6bd624f53dc","lat":40.76849005978132,"lng":-111.89460067570585,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"December 8, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4811804e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"e9c218855a1d4dc0948816f02da9e8d5","lat":40.78047624873506,"lng":-111.89910795147843,"active":true,"__v":0}

I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species.

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 8, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4811804e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"a3a3a4a8808b43f7975aa291c5461ecb","lat":40.76977300347418,"lng":-111.87341585052259,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 9, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4812668e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"5048a61e8ac940a1b59ba75fea0abee9","lat":40.768354352197065,"lng":-111.8947154613869,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"December 9, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4812668e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"85dd2ca82e1448fcbf7c6842c68d481a","lat":40.7804274973922,"lng":-111.89909592802645,"active":true,"__v":0}

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species.

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 9, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4812668e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"41e5fd73a61541f2b6a056e94b91e133","lat":40.76969712994783,"lng":-111.87347615054931,"active":true,"__v":0}

Also available is a wide array of other local and specialty products, including grass-fed meats, specialty cheeses, 100% wild and sustainable seafood, honey, jam, salsa, spreads and more. This diverse range of products includes baked goods and six local natural meat purveyors featuring beef, lamb, pork and eggs.\r\n\r\n\"The fourth season of the Winter Market at Rio Grande opens with a record number of vendors, \" said market director Alison Einerson.

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 10, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4813532e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"150b7f9ffd314412889f685df1377c6c","lat":40.768426071028834,"lng":-111.89454357776935,"active":true,"__v":0}

I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species.

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species.

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species.

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 12, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.481526e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"c22634775edd422d80fbaebf3e05093f","lat":40.76964545399723,"lng":-111.87354109880016,"active":true,"__v":0}

Willam Christensen’s iconic choreography and Tchaikovsky’s score will return in the new production completely intact and with no changes. This will be the fifth incarnation of Willam Christensen’s *The Nutcracker* production, and the first without his oversight.

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 13, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4816124e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"d7bcbd995dfe4dccb4cec1c57e57b31a","lat":40.76838994742099,"lng":-111.89458052735044,"active":true,"__v":0}

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species.

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 13, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4816124e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"4fdb82030b404b31bb6a63e146463127","lat":40.7697009200858,"lng":-111.87352972394413,"active":true,"__v":0}

Willam Christensen’s iconic choreography and Tchaikovsky’s score will return in the new production completely intact and with no changes. This will be the fifth incarnation of Willam Christensen’s *The Nutcracker* production, and the first without his oversight.

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 14, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4816988e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"e166563a9d2d47f8ac4a430851307b00","lat":40.76846877714817,"lng":-111.89452554432205,"active":true,"__v":0}

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species.

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 14, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4816988e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"e97eb588b98143a6a8b51e5794e869ea","lat":40.769648677345124,"lng":-111.87336919953812,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each company brings two of their best and brightest employees to team up with a community leader and youth each. This foursome, together, during a battle of wits, throws their best and brightest answers for their chance to win a Microsoft Surface Pro 4.\r\n\r\nEvent Details\r\n\r\nDate: December 1, 2016\r\n\r\nTime: 5-8 PM\r\n\r\nLocation: Microsoft City Creek, City Creek Center, 51 Main St #145, Salt Lake City, UT 84111\r\n\r\nCost: FREE\r\n\r\nPublic audiences will have the opportunity to experience firsthand the brand new Surface Studio, Virtual Reality worlds, Xbox gaming and an interactive holiday photo booth. Donate at the event to FIND for a chance to win an Xbox One S!  All participants are welcome to bring family and friends to enjoy a fun night of community and emerging technology. \r\n\r\n“We are committed to being a part of the fabric of the local communities in which we operate,” states Valeria Rodriguez, Microsoft Product Advisor in a statement. “We are excited to work with FutureINDesign, which is striving to do the same by increasing opportunities for Utah’s under-represented young adults. We hope this event will not only capture the hard work that FIND and its partners have contributed, but also showcase a program full of possibilities for at-risk youth. Communities everywhere should be apprised of the need to narrow the digital literacy gap through programs like FIND.” \r\n\r\n“Pluralsight’s mission has always been and always will be to democratize technology education,” explains Isaac Strack, Senior Content Strategist for Pluralsight.  “Trivia night is an opportunity to raise awareness, to celebrate something that is truly amazing and, of course, to have some fun!” \r\n\r\n“Our team’s mission is to build and promote a vibrant STEAM culture in Utah that nurtures, attracts and inspires the best and brightest workforce, while strengthening Adobe’s brand of innovation,” explains Brad Daw, Computer Scientist and Software Developer for Adobe and part of the Adobe Steam Team. “We hope to accomplish several things as we participate with FutureINDesign, including encouraging positive contributions to society through technology, supporting STEAM Education and Education Policy on the Hill, and ensuring that our Utah talent pipeline has the interest and skills to ‘Change the world through digital experiences’.” \r\n\r\n“70 percent of people believe that women don’t belong as authorities in architecture. I know I can prove them wrong,” explains one young, hope-filled participant, currently plowing through the beginnings of her schooling in architecture and design.  \r\n\r\n When asked about their legacy, here were a few FutureINDesign students’ responses:\r\n\r\n• “I want to be an example for other people from my [diverse] community.”\r\n\r\n• “I want to motivate other women, especially refugee women. I want them to know to never doubt themselves. We are capable of anything.”\r\n\r\n• “Sometimes I feel like I am a target and that people don’t want me in the workforce. I want to change that for younger generations.” \r\n\r\n“Partners and allies, come for a glimpse into the amazing paths our work together is forging for these young people,” urges Nicholina Womack, CEO and Founder of FutureINDesign. “These young people are more than eager to make change for themselves and leave a legacy for others as well. Please join us for our event and meet these young adults yourself and hear their incredible stories.”\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n**About FIND:** FutureINDesign, dedicated to STEAM career development for marginalized youth, is a Utah-based 501 (c)(3) organization founded in 2015. Its mission is to narrow the digital literacy gap in Utah through immersive training in key technology and life skills, thereby reducing constraints of intergenerational poverty and creating a pipeline of talent for our community’s growing tech workforce.  \r\n\r\nContact Information Liz Coleman   |   206.512.6570   elizabethevacoleman@gmail.com","date":"December 1, 2016","startTime":"17:00","endTime":"20:00","timeValue":1.4806368e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"asenath@citylaunchpr.com","cwId":"4064d0b2e5a64632906a56fc7b000f57","lat":35.42660740476744,"lng":-83.44725253877185,"active":true,"__v":0}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5840b60a665b8c03ded93fc5"},"title":"Children Of Bodom","primCategory":"performing arts","locationName":"The Complex","address":"536 W. 100 South","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Fully 20 years into the tough, heroic grind that represents the  lifeblood of extreme musicians, Finland metal scientists Children of  Bodom have certainly won over crowds globally through a crafted alloy  that is theirs alone. But the building of their esteemed career has also  been aided an abetted by the simple math of all that work, the intense  touring, that inevitable return visit to your town that has made the  band’s shows engaging, personable and energetic thrash parties indelibly  stamped on the circuit boards of headbangers worldwide.  The party continues, with the release of the band’s ninth album, I  Worship Chaos, which finds guitar hero for a new generation Alexi Lahio  recording for the first time in a four-piece configuration (along with  Janne, Jaska and Henkka), given the sudden and recent departure of  long-time co-guitarist Roope Latvala from the ranks.  Which has lent the band a forced but fortuitous sense of focus, says  Alexi: “It was hard because we’ve never been the kind of a band who  changes members every other week. So all of a sudden you are one family  member short. I was obviously on double duty, because I had to record  all the guitars. But I didn’t even care, man; we just went and got  everything done. And I think us parting ways with him has made us strive  and pull together as a group, which was a beautiful thing, really.  Because it felt like we were teenagers again making our first album.  Plus it made the guitars tighter. It’s not like I’m talking shit about  Roope or anything, but it’s just a scientific fact that if there’s one  guy playing everything, it tends to get tighter. And I’m definitely  happy with the result.”  If there’s an increased level of heaviness rippling and rifling through I  Worship Chaos, it might be because the album is constructed with  guitars that are tuned a half step lower. Hence tracks like blackened  thrashers “Horns” and “Suicide Bomber,” as well as the rhythmically  sophisticated “My Bodom (I Am the Only One)” reverberate with bottom end  from both bass and guitar, even if keyboards and the band’s modern  approach to drum mix fight to uphold Children of Bodom’s celebrated  sense of cut, clarity and agility.  All told, says Alexi, “The mission will always be to get as heavy as  possible, but also try to improve as musicians and as songwriters.  Honestly, this is the strongest COB album in a long, long fucking time.  We just wanted to change things up a bit. I think the album has a darker  vibe than the previous ones, especially Halo of Blood—it is definitely  heavier, as well as darker as far as the melodies go. It’s got a lot of  sadness and hurt and anger in it. Which sounds like, hey, what else is  new? But it really is different (laughs).”  The Skyclad-meets-Dark Tranquillity of “Morrigan,” with its expert  synthesis between keyboards and mid-paced riff, with its thump and near  swing feel, is sure to stand out as one of the magic stadium rock  moments of the entire Children of Bodom catalogue.","date":"December 3, 2016","startTime":"18:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4808132e+12,"url":"https://seatgeek.com/children-of-bodom-tickets/salt-lake-city-utah-the-grand-at-the-complex-2016-12-03-6-pm/concert/3494495?aid=605","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"de9865aad356455b912fe9dbad9b274e","lat":40.767630658035515,"lng":-111.9066674449235,"active":true,"__v":0}

Also available is a wide array of other local and specialty products, including grass-fed meats, specialty cheeses, 100% wild and sustainable seafood, honey, jam, salsa, spreads and more.

With more than 60 local vendors (listed at slcfarmersmarket.org) the market is held alternating Saturdays, through April 22, 2017, from 10 AM - 2 PM.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nDue to warm autumn weather conditions, an abundant harvest of produce will be available at the market. Shoppers can expect many items suitable for upcoming holiday meals such as squash, onions, potatoes, carrots, beets, and several varieties of greens.\r\n\r\nFor the first time at Winter Market, fresh locally-raised turkeys will be available for purchase on site. Also available is a wide array of other local and specialty products, including grass-fed meats, specialty cheeses, 100% wild and sustainable seafood, honey, jam, salsa, spreads and more. This diverse range of products includes baked goods and six local natural meat purveyors featuring beef, lamb, pork and eggs.\r\n\r\n\"The fourth season of the Winter Market at Rio Grande opens with a record number of vendors, \" said market director Alison Einerson. We're proud to offer the most diverse product mix seen in any previous years, and I am proud to say this is the best place to source locally raised and grown food throughout the winter.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the products available are unique to the Winter Market; the same is true for non-food products as well. Hosting a Winter Market at the Rio Grande Depot also offers an opportunity to provide additional exposure for the programs and resources found at the Rio Grande Depot, which are overseen by the Utah Department of Heritage and Arts. These include the Rio Gallery and The Utah Division of State History. The Statewide Annual exhibit rotates between Mixed Media \u0026 Works on Paper; Craft, Photography, Video \u0026 Digital works; and Painting \u0026 Sculpture: a preview of the upcoming show will be on display at the first market. \r\n\r\n**Vendor List:**\r\n\r\nVendor\r\n\r\nAbigail's Oven\r\n\r\nAmour Spreads\r\n\r\nAsian \u0026 Heirlooms\r\n\r\nBackyard Urban Garden (B.U.G.)

Your mind is still recording this response of stress and worry  in the background  of your mind. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIf we repeat the pattern several times - the brain creates a habit that money means stress and worry. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nSo now if your mind has 'decided' that money = stress and worry - your automatic mind could be repelling the very money you desire. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nEveryone's brain is set for a certain level of income, your money is a result of how your brain is wired. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nWe are aware of our money habits and behaviors.

Tchaikovsky’s moving score, magical costumes, brilliant choreography, and fairytale sets combine to create a visually stunning production of *The Nutcracker*; underlining why *The New York Times’*principal dance critic called Ballet West’s *The Nutcracker*, “one of the best productions I’ve ever seen.”\r\n___\r\n \r\n___\r\nBallet West’s 61st Season of *The Nutcracker* will be a retirement party—of sorts—for the longest running production in America. In what is being billed as an ‘end of an era,’ Ballet West will retire the current physical production at the end of December to make way for new sets, costumes, and special effects in 2017. Willam Christensen’s iconic choreography and Tchaikovsky’s score will return in the new production completely intact and with no changes. This will be the fifth incarnation of Willam Christensen’s *The Nutcracker* production, and the first without his oversight. While in remarkably good condition, (due to constant, and costly upkeep), the current sets and many costumes are from an update almost 30 years ago.  \r\n___\r\n \r\n___\r\nTo celebrate the history of *The Nutcracker* and give audiences a glimpse at the future production, the Company is curating “Nutcracker Memories,” a free exhibit that will take over the Capitol Room in the Jessie Eccles Quinney Ballet Centre.

Be the LEAD SINGER of a Live Band with This Is Your Band (TIYB), playing here every Thursday night!  This IS the ONLY Live Band Karaoke in Utah...and once you experience it, you'll never look at Karaoke the same!  They have over 1000 songs to choose from - to view their list, go to thisisyourband.com and download their songlist!  Arrive early to get on the list...it fills up fast and we want to hear YOU sing!  Come early and enjoy one of our delicious dinner entrees and your favorite beverages all night long!  This event is SOOOOO popular that the LIST fills up fast, and we want as many of you to be able to sing every Thursday as possible, so please review the following so we can get as many of you up on stage as possible and to avoid any confusion:   1. You must sign up on the list with our KJ - Paul Woody (PDub). He is the ONLY person that can sign people up to sing. Watch for him to arrive and get your name on the list.  2. You must ALREADY have your song picked out when you ask Paul to sign you up - NO EXCEPTIONS.   3. Paul will announce 3 singers at a time: UP NEXT, ON DECK, and IN THE HOLE. When you are in the ON DECK position, you need to be at the stage BEFORE the current singer completes their song so you can go right up. We need you ready to go when it is your turn to avoid delays which takes singing time away. If you ARE NOT ready to take stage when it is your turn, you will lose your turn and will need ask to get back on the list (at the bottom). NO EXCEPTIONS!  3. DO NOT ask to be bumped up on the list - it will not happen. It is not fair to other singers who have been waiting their turn.  4. If you want to be put on the list again after you have sang, you can sign up immediately after completing your song ONLY.  5. A duet counts as one person's song. If a singer invites you up to sing a duet with them, that WILL NOT count as YOUR song, and you will keep your current place on the list.

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 15, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4817852e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"89050644f3e142c398daabf9723ae9d1","lat":40.76840917485958,"lng":-111.89461488615346,"active":true,"__v":0}

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species.

The clucking chickens and drying laundry are somewhat unusual genre elements for the artist, and along with the flawlessly blue sky draw the viewing into one of the most captivating images Stewart ever painted.

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 16, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4818716e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"b955fb802caa48e09d99811f7e1a92a3","lat":40.7683071829649,"lng":-111.89452195007753,"active":true,"__v":0}

Nature, wildlife, and action shots are his favorites. He loves the challenge that arises from the unpredictability of his subjects when he is trying to capture the perfect wildlife moment. He is a native of California but moved to Salt Lake City in July 2013. Mr. Marto grew up in Carmel Valley, CA, so it is no surprise that he gravitated towards wildlife photography. Mountain biking, hiking, tennis, and playing the electric guitar round out the list of pursuits for this U.C. San Diego graduate. He has a beautiful wife and two adorable children.\r\n\r\nPaul’s work has recently been highlighted by *National Geographic*, *USA Today*, *KSL.com*, *Utah.com*, Bolsa Chica Conservancy, Sea \u0026 Sage Audubon Society, The Environmental Nature Center, *Orange County Register*, *Irvine World News*, *Focusingonwildlife.com*, and *WildlifePhotographyNews.net*. He is a recent winner of the City of Irvine's 40th Anniversary Photo Contest and his works have won numerous online photo contests as well. He has been juried into a number of organizations, including LagunaArt.com, AmericaFineArt.org, Artists of America, Gallery 104, RAWArtists.org and TurningArt.com.","date":"December 16, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4818716e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5965/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"1ae80108280c4e299bd818b2d1ab2a6b","lat":40.75661818410129,"lng":-111.91642637373332,"active":true,"__v":0}

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species. My wish is that through my photos, I can help others to appreciate Morocco’s geographic, human, and artistic beauty as well as its rich heritage.","date":"December 16, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4818716e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5923/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"a9599df5b9584382a0fd96455b81d19f","lat":40.72460245266264,"lng":-111.85936264580245,"active":true,"__v":0}

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"Painting primarily with oil-based mediums and house paints, Gibbons works on mid-sized to large canvases and enjoys the physicality of the process as much as the actual outcome. It is the working and reworking, the application of thick layers, and the subsequent scraping that carries significant importance. Marrying colors, employing loose brushwork, and playing with composition on a visceral level are the rewards. Spontaneity is paramount.\r\n\r\nWhile the figurative nature of the work summons a desire to create a story, Gibbons hopes the viewer will create their own narrative and relate to the work on a personal level. Gibbons says she receives many questions regarding particular scenarios occurring within her paintings. \r\n\r\n“I have always gravitated toward figurative painting. I love to watch people, especially when they are introspective and unaware of being observed,” Gibbons says. “Their gestures and mannerisms are fascinating to me.”","date":"December 16, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4818716e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"62f758c559934a28b2851083c9e6f5c3","lat":40.76976502912868,"lng":-111.87341673968731,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"December 17, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.481958e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"5dae384ed4fb4d9a8e5b698c8ffec4f7","lat":40.76831729401803,"lng":-111.89462198012654,"active":true,"__v":0}

Mountain biking, hiking, tennis, and playing the electric guitar round out the list of pursuits for this U.C. San Diego graduate.

I look for subjects wherever I go and try not to limit myself too much. Nevertheless, my subjects are often the natural world, outdoor sports and activities, and international travel, since these are things I’m very interested in and know well. I begin by shooting images that appeal to me due to strong visual components. Perhaps they also possess some sort of cultural or educational significance. Due to the nature of many of my subjects, I often “shoot from the hip” since many rarely hold still for long.\r\n\r\nCurrently, much attention is being focused on the Muslim world. Morocco’s culture blends that of its original Berber inhabitants and its Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region in the fifth century A.D. Politically stable and with an economy geared toward tourism, Morocco is a safe place to observe Muslim art, architecture, and daily life. In 2014, I was fortunate to travel throughout Morocco and witness firsthand the beauty and mystery of this ancient land.\r\n\r\nAs with many who enjoy traveling, I relish observing both the genetic and cultural variations of our species. My wish is that through my photos, I can help others to appreciate Morocco’s geographic, human, and artistic beauty as well as its rich heritage.","date":"December 17, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.481958e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5923/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"08ad41ec111c40938eae1bb35c286c74","lat":40.72452813444189,"lng":-111.85932144091082,"active":true,"__v":0}
