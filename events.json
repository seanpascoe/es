ArtTix is the only official ticketing source for the Zions Bank Broadway at the Eccles series and The Eccles Theater.\r\n___\r\nBEAUTIFUL tells the inspiring true story of King’s remarkable rise to stardom, from being part of a hit songwriting team with her husband Gerry Goffin, to her relationship with fellow writers and best friends Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, to becoming one of the most successful solo acts in popular music history. Along the way, she made more than beautiful music, she wrote the soundtrack to a generation.\r\n\r\nLong before she was Carole King, chart-topping music legend, she was Carol Klein, Brooklyn girl with passion and chutzpah. She fought her way into the record business as a teenager and, by the time she reached her twenties, had the husband of her dreams and a flourishing career writing hits for the biggest acts in rock ‘n’ roll. But it wasn’t until her personal life began to crack that she finally managed to find her true voice.\r\n\r\nFeaturing a stunning array of beloved songs written by Gerry Goffin/Carole King and Barry Mann/Cynthia Weil, including “I Feel The Earth Move,” “One Fine Day,” “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” “You’ve Got A Friend” and the title song, BEAUTIFUL has a book by Tony® Award-nominee and Academy® Award-nominated writer Douglas McGrath, direction by Marc Bruni, choreography by Josh Prince and took home two 2014 Tony® Awards and the 2015 Grammy® for Best Musical Theater Album. BEAUTIFUL is currently playing to sold out crowds at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre on Broadway.\r\n\r\n*Captioned performance for this show is Saturday, November 19th at 2:00PM. Patrons who are interested in the captioned performance should select seats located Orchestra Right on the Main floor.\r\n\r\nRun time: TBA\r\n\r\nRecommended for ages 8 and up. No babes in arms.

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 18, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4794524e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"2f15c9a3a6bc486490251ac70612042e","lat":40.76837470293037,"lng":-111.89455406573477,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 18, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4794524e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"c260175173734f74afa6be5f5f884e84","lat":40.780567146311974,"lng":-111.89913804988178,"active":true,"__v":0}

More importantly, it provides them with a new beginning, a new chapter in their trajectory that sees them redefining their direction, a change in their musical sensibility while maintaining their trademark upbeat attitude\\. \r\nThe band's self titled album, available September 9th on Thirty Tigers Records/ Sons of Thunder Records, introduces vocalist Carleigh Aikins to the line­up, whose previous credits include extended stints with the critically acclaimed bands Bahamas and Fox Jaws\\. Her addition to the band adds an extra edge, highlighting a clear sonic evolution\\. A shift in the band's line­up has opened up new possibilities, swapping electric guitars and amped up instrumentation for the laid back, folk­flavored sound they favored in the past\\. \r\n\"In truth this is an entirely new band,\" bassist Caleb Summeril explains\\. \"With Carleigh coming on board, we've literally made a fresh start\\.\" \r\nGuitarist Paul DeHaven first met Aikins at a concert on Willie Nelson's ranch during South by Southwest in 2012\\. The two hit it off, and before long Aikins and the rest of the band began collaborating long distance via email\\. \"It was serendipitous that we could join forces so seamlessly,\" says Aikins\\. \"We created an instant bond and a new sound we can all stand proudly behind; which merges our respective influences from the Canadian and American music we were raised with\\. Everyone's input is welcome here and everyone has their moment to shine, in the true democratic sense and tradition of a band\\.\" \r\nPaper Bird has always made a point of encouraging each of its members to share the spotlight\\. The group boasts three lead vocalists ­­ singer Sarah Anderson, singer and keyboard player Genevieve Patterson, and Aikins herself ­­ all of whom blend their voices in seamless three part harmonies\\. The instrumental duties are shared by Summeril, DeHaven, and drummer Mark Anderson\\. \r\nHailing from Denver, Colorado, Paper Bird first emerged from the same environs that launched such outfits as Nathaniel Rateliff and the Night Sweats and the Lumineers\\. The group has toured extensively throughout the U\\.S\\., sharing bills with the aforementioned bands, as well as Daryl Hall \u0026 John Oates, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and Shakey Graves\\. \r\nOn Paper Bird, the band collaborates with world­renowned musician, singer and songwriter John Oates, who co­produced the album with Aikins' fellow Canadian David Kalmusky\\. The album was recorded and mixed at Addiction Sound Studios in Nashville, and for his part, Oates couldn't be more delighted\\. \r\n\"Paper Bird is a band that possesses a sound that's more than the sum of its parts,\" Oates effuses\\. \"It's the coming together of two perfect trinities\\. It has three distinctly unique female lead singers whose harmonies blend together as one\\.\\.\\.united with an inventive, cohesive rhythm section trio\\. I loved their sound from the first time I heard them and they just keep getting better\\. They are a true musical family united by a unique and pure artistic vision\\.\\.\\.a rare quality in this day and age of so much disposable and less than original music\\.\" \r\nPaper Bird has a sound that blends the engaging vocal harmonies of Fleet Foxes and The Lone Bellow with the classic '70s stylings of bands like Heart and Fleetwood Mac without imitating or emulating any one of them in particular\\.

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 19, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4795388e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"3681fd18e2be4e88accf74be5679b087","lat":40.76847644071298,"lng":-111.89460160568913,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 19, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4795388e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"e505e18f9ced4398a35294b46e02810f","lat":40.78050404031235,"lng":-111.89910708440031,"active":true,"__v":0}

ArtTix is the only official ticketing source for the Zions Bank Broadway at the Eccles series and The Eccles Theater.\r\n___\r\nBEAUTIFUL tells the inspiring true story of King’s remarkable rise to stardom, from being part of a hit songwriting team with her husband Gerry Goffin, to her relationship with fellow writers and best friends Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, to becoming one of the most successful solo acts in popular music history. Along the way, she made more than beautiful music, she wrote the soundtrack to a generation.\r\n\r\nLong before she was Carole King, chart-topping music legend, she was Carol Klein, Brooklyn girl with passion and chutzpah. She fought her way into the record business as a teenager and, by the time she reached her twenties, had the husband of her dreams and a flourishing career writing hits for the biggest acts in rock ‘n’ roll. But it wasn’t until her personal life began to crack that she finally managed to find her true voice.\r\n\r\nFeaturing a stunning array of beloved songs written by Gerry Goffin/Carole King and Barry Mann/Cynthia Weil, including “I Feel The Earth Move,” “One Fine Day,” “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” “You’ve Got A Friend” and the title song, BEAUTIFUL has a book by Tony® Award-nominee and Academy® Award-nominated writer Douglas McGrath, direction by Marc Bruni, choreography by Josh Prince and took home two 2014 Tony® Awards and the 2015 Grammy® for Best Musical Theater Album. BEAUTIFUL is currently playing to sold out crowds at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre on Broadway.\r\n\r\n*Captioned performance for this show is Saturday, November 19th at 2:00PM.

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 21, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4797116e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"af4ae8ac7d2f4a7f807c12a9495ff2fc","lat":40.780575380156236,"lng":-111.89925329054545,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 22, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.479798e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"e9dc84fbfd014336a3c21e7544e857fa","lat":40.768383316411885,"lng":-111.894583935566,"active":true,"__v":0}

By reimagining art historical notions of form, space, and process, the artists presented in *Object[ed]: Shaping Sculpture in Contemporary Art* cleverly and skillfully illuminate the realms between painting and sculpture, objectivity and subjectivity, as well as production and consumption. \r\n\r\nArtist List: Olga Balema, Caitlin Cherry, Lizze Määttälä, Leeza Meksin, Tove Storch, Gili Tal","date":"November 22, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.479798e+12,"url":"http://www.utahmoca.org/portfolio/objected/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"399ccfc8d2ea4cdab4f483631d73efe5","lat":40.76833935519518,"lng":-111.8945576179975,"active":true,"__v":0}

My pieces represent a place, moment, or an experience that I try to capture. Through my own photographs, a loved one’s photo, or an image that evokes an emotion, each painting has a place and time connected to it. My artwork tells the story of my life. It takes me back to the place where my grandfather spent his last weeks, where my husband learned to love people in a distant land, where a close cousin and friend had a baby, and sometimes to where I find beauty in the least expected places. By creating a permanent image on canvas, I am able to share with others a perspective from a corner of my mind where love, inspiration, and light reside.","date":"November 22, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.479798e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"09238b50854f45b4b4de337872ec73a3","lat":40.74443334666471,"lng":-111.83011516947323,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 22, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.479798e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"626bed5e4102476d8fc3f77673e43ee1","lat":40.780603978357234,"lng":-111.89920284376765,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 23, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4798844e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"6e2afe04dd21421d99da752b16a92491","lat":40.76838552701561,"lng":-111.8946670991459,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 23, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4798844e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"4fba16be46b04896b0b86eeaa1175105","lat":40.78054940995418,"lng":-111.89920452744799,"active":true,"__v":0}

Be the LEAD SINGER of a Live Band with This Is Your Band (TIYB), playing here every Thursday night!  This IS the ONLY Live Band Karaoke in Utah...and once you experience it, you'll never look at Karaoke the same!  They have over 1000 songs to choose from - to view their list, go to thisisyourband.com and download their songlist!  Arrive early to get on the list...it fills up fast and we want to hear YOU sing!  Come early and enjoy one of our delicious dinner entrees and your favorite beverages all night long!  This event is SOOOOO popular that the LIST fills up fast, and we want as many of you to be able to sing every Thursday as possible, so please review the following so we can get as many of you up on stage as possible and to avoid any confusion:   1. You must sign up on the list with our KJ - Paul Woody (PDub). He is the ONLY person that can sign people up to sing. Watch for him to arrive and get your name on the list.  2. You must ALREADY have your song picked out when you ask Paul to sign you up - NO EXCEPTIONS.   3. Paul will announce 3 singers at a time: UP NEXT, ON DECK, and IN THE HOLE. When you are in the ON DECK position, you need to be at the stage BEFORE the current singer completes their song so you can go right up. We need you ready to go when it is your turn to avoid delays which takes singing time away. If you ARE NOT ready to take stage when it is your turn, you will lose your turn and will need ask to get back on the list (at the bottom). NO EXCEPTIONS!  3. DO NOT ask to be bumped up on the list - it will not happen. It is not fair to other singers who have been waiting their turn.  4. If you want to be put on the list again after you have sang, you can sign up immediately after completing your song ONLY.  5. A duet counts as one person's song. If a singer invites you up to sing a duet with them, that WILL NOT count as YOUR song, and you will keep your current place on the list.    It is BEST to arrive early to get your name on the list and get up as quickly as possible. That MAY improve your chance to sing again later in the evening, but is NOT a guarantee.","date":"November 24, 2016","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4800464e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"60c2dfb3bf684d718afcc890d7125cfe","lat":40.58673527384378,"lng":-111.89550666345168,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 24, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4799708e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"0cd3f2ec0de043e6808186fa16c66b9e","lat":40.76845259551972,"lng":-111.89452637876461,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 24, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4799708e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"922578022c3642e8bae0ecee7ff0c035","lat":40.78052186170979,"lng":-111.89919638376367,"active":true,"__v":0}

Mountain biking, hiking, tennis, and playing the electric guitar round out the list of pursuits for this U.C. San Diego graduate. He has a beautiful wife and two adorable children.\r\n\r\nPaul’s work has recently been highlighted by *National Geographic*, *USA Today*, *KSL.com*, *Utah.com*, Bolsa Chica Conservancy, Sea \u0026 Sage Audubon Society, The Environmental Nature Center, *Orange County Register*, *Irvine World News*, *Focusingonwildlife.com*, and *WildlifePhotographyNews.net*.

The late Alvin Ailey himself called his work, “Revelations”... “blood history.” And, as PCI executive director Teri Orr puts it, “You cannot watch that powerful, exhausting, beautiful piece filled with gospel music and not feel like you have been both schooled and churched.” The company, known as “America’s dance company” was a critical part of the Eccles opening season in 1998 and has continued to evolve and return to the Park City stage with new works and exquisite soul-touching movement over the past two decades.","date":"November 25, 2016","startTime":"19:30","endTime":"22:00","timeValue":1.4801274e+12,"url":"https://tickets.parkcity.institute/TheatreManager/1/tmEvent/tmEvent442.html","host":"Billy, Park City Institute","contactNumber":"435-655-3114","contactEmail":"boxoffice@parkcity.iinstitute","cwId":"66dbd412f2a548a9890f0f4cdc5707f5","lat":40.667428287849845,"lng":-111.49655539876895,"active":true,"__v":0}

Extreme times demand extreme responses. Silence sucks. Noise is always the answer. And yes, NAPALM DEATH continue to be one of the few bands on this planet that adhere to all these principles and more. For the last three decades, their name has been synonymous with heavy music taken to the extreme - music that confronts, confounds and eviscerates in equal measure.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nNAPALM DEATH's enduring impact on the world of sonic savagery began in earnest in the late 80s, when the band's first two albums - 1987's Scum and its 1988 follow-up From Enslavement To Obliteration - refined and redefined the notion of brutality and velocity in the worlds of punk, hardcore and metal. Endorsed by legendary and much-missed DJ John Peel, the Brummie grindcore pioneers were such an exhilarating and yet alien dose of jolting adrenaline that even the mainstream media were forced to prick up their ears and take note. Throw in the fact that NAPALM DEATH were - and still are - driven by a ferocious intelligence and a genuine desire to make the world a better place through the promotion of rational thought and respect for all fellow humans, they stood apart from the often nihilistic and intellectually bankrupt underground metal scene and have remained unique and unerring ever since. While grind purists may point to those earliest records as evidence of the band's significance, it is the tireless and terrorising exploits of the now classic line-up of vocalist Mark 'Barney' Greenway, bassist Shane Embury, guitarist Mitch Harris and drummer Danny Herrera that have cemented NAPALM DEATH's status as extreme music legends. Over the last 20 years, the band have released a relentless slew of groundbreaking and fearless albums and other releases that have consistently punched holes in the heavy music world's perimeter fence, espousing an indestructible credo of creativity and lyrical fire along the way.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nHowever, unlike the vast majority of so-called veteran bands, NAPALM DEATH seem to be gaining momentum and focus as their story continues into its fourth decade. Albums like Smear Campaign (2006), Time Waits For No Slave (2009) and Utilitarian (2012) have proved beyond doubt that while their creators remain firmly at the forefront of the grindcore scene, they are also increasingly capable of expanding the boundaries of their own sound while exhibiting an undying passion for incorporating the most unimaginably intense and perverse fresh elements into their otherwise remorselessly fast and furious blueprint. And now, with the release of their fifteenth studio album, Apex Predator - Easy Meat, the undisputed Gods of Grind are poised to shatter preconceptions and redefine what it means to be truly extreme all over again.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"I guess the word to use is thrusting! It really goes for the throat!\" says Barney. \"People probably look at NAPALM and think 'Fuck me, is that band still around?' There's a natural tendency as bands go on, that people on the outside say 'Oh, they're still making albums but they must be a bit humdrum now...' and you know what? That's something that I hope no one ever says about us. I find I don't want something more refined or less extreme, I want something more extreme. Sometimes we'll be in the studio and someone will say 'Isn't that a bit noisy?' and I'll say 'Fucking hell, what do you mean? Turn it up! Let's go and throw a microphone through the speaker!' So that's our attitude. The age of the band should never come into it. Just because you're older, it doesn't mean you lose the urge to make something challenging... or even annoying! Some of the sounds that NAPALM use are deliberately designed to annoy people, no question!\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nA sprawling and frequently bewildering onslaught of fervently left-field and fiendishly inventive extremity, Apex Predator - Easy Meat takes everything that NAPALM DEATH have learned, absorbed and harnessed over the last 30 years and twists the resultant maelstrom into an unfathomable, tooth-shattering squall of ferocity. There is plenty of the hyperspeed grind that fans have long become accustomed to, but the more artful and dissonant elements that have long lurked within the band's sound have been brought violently the fore like never before. As influenced by Swans, Killing Joke and Throbbing Gristle as they are by Siege, Celtic Frost and Discharge, these new songs add a wild array of new textures and tones to NAPALM DEATH's sonic realm - all mixed to abominable perfection by long-time studio comrade Russ Russell - as slow-motion psychedelic sludge, barbaric post-industrial skree and flat-out quasi-electronic antagonism collide around the band's trademark barrage of warped riffing and throat-flaying roars.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"The title track, it's like Public Image Limited times ten!\" says Barney. \"It's really extreme. There's a lot of those influences on the album - Public Image, Killing Joke, Swans... all that kind of stuff. We were starting to do it on the last album, mixing it into the fast stuff, but this time we've mixed it in even more. Some of the chord stuff on there is pretty fucking mad. It was intentional. Sonically, we wanted it to be even more extreme. It's quite simple. We're not fucking around! Therein comes the paradox. You've got the really nasty, horrible, violent sound and then the really humane lyrics. I love that paradox.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nOnce again proclaiming their refusal to stand by while the world plummets rapidly down the shit-chute, the new NAPALM DEATH album is plainly one of the most lyrically incisive and enriching records of the band's career to date. Inspired by real world events and the never-ending cycle of predatory capitalism that causes so much poverty, misery and death around the globe, songs like Dear Slum Landlord..., Metaphorically Screw You and Hierarchies are as uncompromising and vital on a conceptual level as they are in musical terms. As ever, Barney's humanistic worldview blazes brightly throughout - a positive voice in a wilderness of apathy and hate.\r\n\r\nThe Black Dahlia Murder\r\n\r\nTwitter\r\n\r\nFacebook\r\n\r\nWebsite\r\n\r\nThe problem of dropping a record as career-defining as 2013's Everblack is that the bar is set so high following it up is a galling task. That The Black Dahlia Murder's response to such a challenge comes in the form of the devastating Abysmal serves to once again demonstrate why they are considered one of the most vital bands in contemporary death metal. \"Once the record started to come together we knew it was going to be something special,\" states vocalist Trevor Strnad. \"It's more urgent, it has more dynamics, it's a more emotive record, and it has a more raw, angry sound to it. It's still million mile-per-hour death metal, but when you invest so much thought and emotion into what you're creating you end up with a record that does stand out, and we can hold our heads up high and say yeah, this is our best work.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nSince 2001, the Michigan quintet have focused their efforts on writing music that embraces all the finest qualities of melodic death metal yet does not shackle them, giving them room to constantly evolve and grow as musicians. With Abysmal the band have once again progressed while retaining the signature sound that has won them their devoted legion of fans, and making it clear that their best is not in their past. \"I still love Everblack and everything we achieved when touring it, and in fact going into that record we faced a massive challenge in following up Ritual (2011), which had also been huge for us. Having two records in a row connect with fans in such a way was amazing, but definitely piled on the pressure going into this new one, because we don't want to let them down, and we don't want to let ourselves down. But we learned a lot in making those two records, and we brought that into Abysmal. We know we can take people's heads off playing super fast, but that doesn't always give listeners something to really chew on. We've learned to focus on creating some drama, interesting dynamics, and most importantly really investing time in thinking about how different parts of songs will make you feel.\" While crushingly violent, Abysmal is certainly a long way from being a two-dimensional blast-fest. Often evoking potent melancholy or icy unease, tragedy and apocalyptic gloom also insinuate into the songs alongside the all-out fury, for make no mistake, while this record boasts a variety of dark and atmospheric moods the band have perhaps never sounded so downright pissed. The likes of \"Re-Faced\" and \"Threat Level Number Three\" are purpose built to incite chaos, and some of the fastest material the band has ever unleashed explodes from the likes of opener \"Receipt\", \"Asylum\", and the haunting title track. This can largely be credited to drummer Alan Cassidy, who joined the band in 2013. \"With both Alan and Max (Lavelle, bass) new to the band there was a lot of speculation ahead of dropping Everblack, and though we knew we had a great record it was nice to prove the naysayers wrong. This time out Alan was really able to stamp his identity on the record, and yeah, there was a point where Brian (Eschbach, guitar) said level with me dude: just how fast can you go? And Alan unleashed this thing and we were like okay, let's go faster than we've ever gone then!\" Strnad laughs. \"But it's not just that, he's injected so much style into everything. He writes really interesting fills, and he cares about having variety and really speaking with what he's doing, and he was involved with the song writing more than any other drummer has been in a long time.\" Strnad is just as keen to sing the praises of Lavelle, who also made a more substantial contribution to the record than he did to its predecessor. \"We look back on every record and say we need more bass, and Max is a really prevalent part of things live, so we wanted to have that come across more, and he totally nailed it. It's definitely a dirtier bass sound than we've ever had too, which sounds more wild, more live, and adds to the punch.\" Guitarists Eschbach and Ryan Knight bring a cavalcade of riffs to the table, upping the stakes in technicality, melody, and sheer blunt force trauma, letting intoxicating flavors of black metal and NWOBHM creep into the vicious assault, and Knight's soloing is at a point where Strnad believes his name should rightfully be thrown in amongst the genre's most prominent shredders. \"With every album we allow a bit more time for him to solo and just totally own it, and when he nails it he's really at that Megadeth Rust In Peace level. I do think he deserves to be spoken about in the circles of great metal guitar players. Marty Friedman should buy Ryan a beer, I think, and I genuinely don't see that as something really out of the ballpark.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nOf course, Strnad's own contributions are a vital aspect of every TBDM album, and he once again delivers, both in regards to his lyrics and caustic vocals. While his lyrical inspiration remains primarily rooted in horror and the macabre, on Abysmal the theme of hell is prominent, whether it be a literal hell, figurative, or personal one. \"Stygiophobic\", for instance, which is a slower, crunchy, doom-inflected dirge, sees him focusing on those who are irrationally afraid of hell. \"These people spend their every waking moment thinking of going to hell, and every time they go to sleep they see all their friends burning in hell, and this obsession has become a debilitating psychological condition, which is awful, and interesting.\" Alongside this, on the scathing \"Threat Level Number Three\" Strnad goes inside the mind of a \"recidivist rapist molester, who has been chemically castrated, focusing on his internal dialogue as he's trying to reenter society.\" He explores more fantastic subjects, such as the cruelty and violence of Vlad The Impaler - the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula - in the more melancholic \"Vlad, Son Of The Dragon\", and he also reflects on issues that have affected him more personally, allowing himself some form of catharsis, most notably on \"Receipt\" and the title track. However, while despair, isolation, and thoughts of suicide haunt these songs, on burly closer \"That Cannot Die Which Eternally Is Dead\" he pushes the band's perseverance in the faces of those who might consider counting them out. \"What I'm saying in that song is that we can't be stopped by normal means. No matter what kind of challenge or roadblock we face we'll just keep coming, and I think by now our fans know that.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn tracking the record, the band re-enlisted producer Mark Lewis (Cannibal Corpse, Whitechapel) and former bass player Ryan Williams, who also helped engineer Everblack, their intent to get away from the overt sonic sterility affecting far too many contemporary metal albums. This is a prominent factor in why the record sounds as angry as it does, the band focusing on capturing a raw, live sound that doesn't always strive for absolute perfection. \"We wanted a sound that would show we're actually human beings, and not just computers playing death metal. We were not going to resample the drums, sound-replace or quantize anything. We didn't want to have the exact same drum sound as every single freaking band seems to have right now, and that's why essentially going backwards was going forwards for us. The guys have the chops to do it, so it's not like we need to lean on Pro-Tools to make an album, and I think it's the most energetic thing we've done since the very first record, Unhallowed (2003), which had a similar live feel.\" As always, artwork was of great importance in expressing the band's vision, and this time they turned to Russian artist Daemorph, who is known for his work in the brutal death metal community. \"Again, I was a little unsure quite how we would follow up Everblack, because the artwork Nicholas Keller did was incredible. But we told Daemorph we wanted something that really looked like hell, and he went above and beyond. The first time I saw it I was like yep, that's hell, and I know I definitely don't want to go there!\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAt this stage in the game, with typically modest aspirations, Strnad is more interested in maintaining their longevity than shifting records, and if the band never gets any bigger than they are right now he will \"die happy a hundred times over\". However, this does not mean there is anything even vaguely resembling an end in sight. \"We're still young at heart and I feel like the evolution of the band still has a long way to go. I don't see a ceiling on what we can do, and there will be no end. It's just going to be a constant ongoing fight to make better music and be a better band, and it's always going to be time to kick ass.\"\r\n\r\nMisery Index\r\n\r\nTwitter\r\n\r\nFacebook\r\n\r\nWebsite\r\n\r\nMISERY INDEX combine the ferocity and precision of death metal with the chaotic attack of Grindcore, Hardcore and Crust. MISERY INDEX set no limits in their goal of making death metal and grind flow together, drawing influence from the classic Death and Grind releases of the early 90's, such as those from MORBID ANGEL, NAPALM DEATH, TERRORIZER, DISRUPT, BOLT THROWER, ASSUCK and ENTOMBED, among others. The imagery and lyrical concepts are also very critical to the band, and one can expect that in the true nature of the genre, MISERY INDEX will catapult their anger to the forefront, shoving the depravity of our planet right back in the face of all who passively accept the status quo (and have considerable fun while doing it).\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nMISERY INDEX began as a studio project in 2001, when vocalist and bassist Jason Netherton (ex-DYING FETUS) joined together with guitarist / vocalist Mike Harrison and drummer Kevin Talley (ex-DYING FETUS) to record their debut EP \"Overthrow\". This five-song death/grind attack received considerable praise in underground circles, shifting Misery Index into a full time project with the addition of Sparky Voyles (ex-DYING FETUS) on guitar.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn 2002, Mike Harrison and Kevin Talley left the band to focus on other projects and the latter was replaced by Matt Byers, who took up drum duties for their first US tour that summer in support of KATAKLYSM. In 2003, MISERY INDEX released their first full-length \"Retaliate\", to exceptional reviews and numerous tours in Europe and North America supporting bands such as DYING FETUS, AMON AMARTH, DEICIDE, and NILE. In 2004 a video for \"The Great Depression\" was released, complimenting their first live DVD, which featured a full set recorded in Athens, Greece. Later in 2004, Adam Jarvis (ex-ALL WILL FALL, currently in PIG DESTROYER) took over on drums, just in time for MISERY INDEX to hit such European festivals as Wacken Open Air, Brutal Assault, and Party.San Open Air, followed with more touring alongside bands such as BEHEMOTH, NAPALM DEATH, SUFFOCATION, ROTTEN SOUND, and MAGRUDERGRIND. In 2005, guitarist and vocalist Mark Kloeppel (ex-CAST THE STONE) joined Jason, Adam and Sparky, solidifying the line-up for the next five years. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn 2006, second full-length \"Discordia\" was unleashed, followed by even more persistent touring with bands such as FEAR FACTORY, DESPISED ICON, JOB FOR A COWBOY, BENEATH THE MASSACRE, NECROPHAGIST and ORIGIN. In 2007, MISERY INDEX appeared on festivals like Hellfest in France and Tuska in Finland, as well as hitting places like Turkey, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania and Croatia for the first time. However, despite being on the road for months, MISERY INDEX were ready to finalise their third album, so recordings commenced with Kurt Ballou (CONVERGE) at God City Studios in May of 2008. Later that year \"Traitors\" was released and the band embarked on their next tour with ORIGIN and ABYSMAL DAWN right as the album was hitting stores. Reactions from both critics and fans were raving and the album showcased an exceptional return to form.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn 2008 and 2009, the band toured extensively, playing with and supporting bands such as THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER, SOILENT GREEN, HATE ETERNAL, THE FACELESS, CANNIBAL CORPSE, PSYCROPTIC and many more, as well as seeing their first trips to places like Mexico, Russia and Iceland, an appearance on the prestigious Extreme the Dojo festivals in Japan, the Maryland Deathfest in Baltimore and European festivals such as Summer Breeze, Party.San, Hellfest, and Death Feast. Entering 2010, the band booked time at Wrightway Studios with producer Steve Wright in their home state of Maryland to commence recording of the fourth album. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nMISERY INDEX released \"Heirs to Thievery\" in May 2010, dropping like a bomb on the Death Metal masses and shattering all expectations. The album was both a commercial and critical success, elevating the band into headlining slots in both Europe and the United States. \"Heirs to Thievery\" showcased the growing maturity and depth of the band, as the varied songwriting shifted naturally from nuanced, blasting technicality (\"Fed to the Wolves\"), through pit-inducing groove (\"The Carrion Call\"), to crushing heaviness (\"The 7th Cavalry\"). The growth and penetrating hooks of the songs took the band to new levels and was followed by several tours with bands such as GRAVE and AEON in Europe, PSYCROPTIC, ORIGIN, and DECAPITATED in Australia and DESPISED ICON, REVOCATION, JOB FOR A COWBOY, GOATWHORE, and EYEHATEGOD in North America. 2010 also saw the departure of long time guitarist Sparky Voyles, who was replaced by Darin Morris.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nFestivals followed in 2011, with MISERY INDEX making appearances at Obscene Extreme, Tuska, With Full Force, Metalfest Open Air and Neurotic Death Fest, as well as seeing their first visit to countries such as Colombia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. In 2012, the band made an appearance supporting CANNIBAL CORPSE on their US \"Torture\" tour, while also joining the Full of Hate festival tour in Europe alongside CANNIBAL CORPSE, BEHEMOTH and LEGION OF THE DAMNED. On the Munich date of the \"Full of Hate\" tour, the band recorded their first live album. The album will be released on numbered, die-cut vinyl and digital download in February 2013.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn their 12-year existence, MISERY INDEX have released four studio albums, several EPs and performed over 1000 concerts in 45+ countries. Their long-awaited new full-length is expected in 2013 on Season of Mist.\r\n\r\nAbnormality\r\n\r\nFacebook\r\n\r\nWebsite\r\n\r\nAbnormality is an extreme metal band hailing from Massachusetts, United States. Purveying a violent hybrid of the heaviest subgenres in metal, Abnormality mixes technicality and speed with devastating grooves. Taking from a wide range of influences, Abnormality captures the speed and unrelenting viciousness of Hate Eternal and Origin and infuses it with grooves and hooks more reminiscent of Suffocation and Deeds of Flesh. Abnormality came together in 2005, and now features seasoned members Mallika, Jay, Josh, Ben, and Jeremy, all hailing from various underground acts such as Goratory, Ascendancy, Sexcrement, Revengeance, and Iranach. Abnormality strives to bury the weak female fronted gimmick, and deliver a brutal sonic experience that death metal fans cannot","date":"November 7, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4785704e+12,"url":"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1309253-napalm-death-black-dahlia-salt-lake-city/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"80f845561f67427fafe67310d0e579f1","lat":40.767160380867196,"lng":-111.90889586963914,"active":true,"__v":0}

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"A new exhibition, *Iterations, *will be on view at the Alice Gallery Sept. 16 –Nov. 11, 2016. The exhibition features artwork by Utah artists Sue Martin and Nancy Vorm.\r\n\r\n Inspired by artists past and present who are known for iterations (Cezanne, Monet, and Jasper Johns, to name a few), Sue Martin and Nancy Vorm give viewers a glimpse into their creative processes, both intensely introspective and playful.\r\n\r\nSue Martin selected a single photograph taken on a trip to Zion National Park in February. She reflected on the times she has stopped at that very place, each time with a different travel companion, to snap a picture. Geological layering and erosion became a metaphor for layering and erosion of memory.\r\n\r\n“After three paintings, I set the photo aside and worked from memory,” Martin said. “Without all that detail in front of me, I could select those elements that were most memorable and play with color, line, and texture that expressed the essence of the memory.”\r\n\r\nNancy Vorm’s abstract encaustic paintings incorporate inks, rust, monotype prints, and collaged elements to create a surface that is richly textured through many layers of beeswax. Her iterative journey began when a friend gave her some rusted metal pieces in flower shapes. With a roll of her eyes that said, “I don’t do flowers,” she nevertheless began to imagine ways to make the motif her own. Printing the rusted objects on paper, and using walnut and India inks on Kozopapers, she began to add patterns, then to overlap and layer elements, until the motif was less a flower and more a shape and texture to incorporate into her many-layered abstractions.\r\n\r\nVorm’s use of Martin’s “layer” motif in some of her pieces was a nod to the collaborative spirit the two artists developed over the five months of working together.","date":"November 7, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.478502e+12,"url":"http://visualarts.utah.gov","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"0246ead13bd24e298a137d182f0131a0","lat":40.76969248360672,"lng":-111.87337582672504,"active":true,"__v":0}

Nature, wildlife, and action shots are his favorites. He loves the challenge that arises from the unpredictability of his subjects when he is trying to capture the perfect wildlife moment. He is a native of California but moved to Salt Lake City in July 2013. Mr. Marto grew up in Carmel Valley, CA, so it is no surprise that he gravitated towards wildlife photography. Mountain biking, hiking, tennis, and playing the electric guitar round out the list of pursuits for this U.C. San Diego graduate. He has a beautiful wife and two adorable children.\r\n\r\nPaul’s work has recently been highlighted by *National Geographic*, *USA Today*, *KSL.com*, *Utah.com*, Bolsa Chica Conservancy, Sea \u0026 Sage Audubon Society, The Environmental Nature Center, *Orange County Register*, *Irvine World News*, *Focusingonwildlife.com*, and *WildlifePhotographyNews.net*. He is a recent winner of the City of Irvine's 40th Anniversary Photo Contest and his works have won numerous online photo contests as well.

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 7, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.478502e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"91d989f2357245e98272ef1659c7705f","lat":40.780486032478976,"lng":-111.89918636564782,"active":true,"__v":0}

In the three years since, the band suffered the tragic death of founding bassist Chris Friedrich, and thus felt torn between grief's desire to hide away from everything and yet knowing immediately that the band needed to continue. But going on meant maintaining a grueling tour schedule, with the members vacillating between elation and utter exhaustion. \"Traveling can create a feeling of separation at times,\" says guitarist and founding member Phil Jamieson. \"After a while, you can forget why you're out there in the first place. Deciding to do another record after all that was a move to reclaim for ourselves why it is that we do all this: Music is our strongest antidote to feelings of emptiness and disquiet.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nTo record the album, Caspian returned to Q Division Studios in Somerville, Massachusetts, the stamping grounds where they recorded the highly acclaimed Waking Season (\"the Best Post-Rock Album of Year,\" said SPIN Magazine in 2012). They also looked again to the legendary chops of Matt Bayles (Mastodon, Isis, MONO, Minus the Bear) to produce, mix, and engineer the record.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n2015 also marks a decade since the band's inception. Ten years ago, Caspian played a show as a four-piece band at a small pub in their still-home base of Beverly, Massachusetts. After months of practicing before their first gig, never worrying about what it was they were trying to create beyond music that could tell a story, they arrived at a bombastic sound—guitars from Phil Jamieson and Cal Joss that sounded like a 40-piece orchestra, stripped-down drums that showed Joe Vickers could literally control chaos, and a bass sound so big from Chris Friedrich it blew amplifiers almost as often as he changed notes.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nTheir sound only deepened and thickened over the years with the addition of guitarists Erin Burke-Moran and Jonny Ashburn, and touring-cum-permanent bassist Jani Zubkovs.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWith a sound this expansive, lyrics were simply unnecessary. And yet, 673 shows after their first appearance and on the advent of their fifth studio recording, Jamieson still says, \"I view us as storytellers and musicians equally.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThat focus on narrative has continued across all of their albums, as otherwise the band would risk becoming a parody of themselves and the post-rock genre they've always acquiesced to with crossed fingers behind their backs. \"We can do soundscapes, reverb-drenched drones, and songs based around a repeating melody that build and build for 12 minutes until we are blue in the face,\" Jamieson says. \"It is trying to convey a story through song structure, use of melody, and dynamics that has been the driving motivation from day one for this band.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThere has always been a fluidity to the arcs in Caspian records, where words like story and narrative held a loftier, mythic place in the movement to each album. We're invited to enter and exit on our own terms, using the music as a railing to help us wander the dark hallways of our mind. The declarative title of You Are the Conductor (2005) announced that the music would take the listener on a journey, but where things went would be determined by the mood and circumstance of the listener. Each subsequent record refined and pushed the sounds into more surprising territory, showing the band's ability to craft structures that the listener could inhabit—The Four Trees (2007) with its skyward glance, Tertia (2010) with its fists in the dirt, and Waking Season (2012) looking for the human in the machine. Raw emotion was always present, but it remained aloof, undefined. You felt it, but the feeling would dissipate just when you thought you could name what it was you were feeling.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nBut with Dust and Disquiet, the story has changed.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAs much as grief wishes to be private, the passing of bassist Chris Friedrich left an indelible mark on the band, and it's impossible not to see stark traces of this tragedy across the album. The whole of the record transcends their personal grief, but as Jamieson says, \"It is and always will be, now, an underlying core to everything the band creates.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThey are forever marked by loss, but not defined by it.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAs such, Dust and Disquiet showcases a maturation of the quiet/loud dynamic that Caspian has been exploring since their debut EP, You Are the Conductor. Now, that dynamic extends beyond a matter of volume, suggesting a more figurative exploration of polarities such as dark/light, dry/wet, and tired/awake. And these elements are not limited to one elongated track, but rather stretch out over an ambitious and yet patient album that opens with horns and a string quartet (\"Separation No. 2\"), riffs on the wilder, steel-eyed side of country (\"Rioseco\") and classical (\"Aeternum Vale\"), all the while staying true to its epic brand of build-and-release rock (\"Arcs of Command,\" \"Dust and Disquiet\").\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nOn a first listen, then, a track like \"Run Dry\" might seem surprising for a band that, for the past ten years, has relied on their textured and explosive style of instrumental music to tell their story. And while this acoustic ballad is noticeable simply due to its unique sonic profile among the band's catalog, there is a sobering quality that holds the listener in place. We are brought into their present moment, and we remain there indefinitely, even if the song only lasts less than five minutes. It may sound calm, but there is tension in the song's desert air stillness. In the end, the track becomes a piece of an album that is the widest expression of the kind of connective work Caspian has been up to since the beginning.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIt's for this reason that the diversity of Dust and Disquiet—from the horns and string quartet that open and close the record to the primal honesty evident in tracks such as \"Echo and Abyss\" and \"Darkfield\"—bluntly assures they need no parlor tricks in order to keep their particular brand of instrumental music fresh. \"The record has a genuine sincerity to it,\" Jamieson says, \"because we are still using the creative act as a weapon to combat feelings of emptiness and isolation. It is still a mechanism used toward connection to one's self and to other people in an age of increasing separation.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAnd that work is palpable throughout Dust and Disquiet. Images come into focus—the physical world and the world of imagination are one. Most of life is set up to break that connection, but Caspian is wide awake now, and they are expressly in the business of reconnecting.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nDust and Disquiet will be released on September 25, 2015 on Triple Crown Records, Big Scary Monsters (Europe), Hobbledehoy Records (Australia).","date":"November 8, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4786568e+12,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/events/1770080619916386","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"c9847ddb3beb4bf4a8fa2727d7dec333","lat":40.76374161187845,"lng":-111.87578007962577,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 8, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4785884e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"d8b9b80551f94e9aa459ce3352cc9fda","lat":40.76848377096853,"lng":-111.89455746068558,"active":true,"__v":0}

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"A new exhibition, *Iterations, *will be on view at the Alice Gallery Sept. 16 –Nov. 11, 2016. The exhibition features artwork by Utah artists Sue Martin and Nancy Vorm.\r\n\r\n Inspired by artists past and present who are known for iterations (Cezanne, Monet, and Jasper Johns, to name a few), Sue Martin and Nancy Vorm give viewers a glimpse into their creative processes, both intensely introspective and playful.\r\n\r\nSue Martin selected a single photograph taken on a trip to Zion National Park in February. She reflected on the times she has stopped at that very place, each time with a different travel companion, to snap a picture. Geological layering and erosion became a metaphor for layering and erosion of memory.\r\n\r\n“After three paintings, I set the photo aside and worked from memory,” Martin said. “Without all that detail in front of me, I could select those elements that were most memorable and play with color, line, and texture that expressed the essence of the memory.”\r\n\r\nNancy Vorm’s abstract encaustic paintings incorporate inks, rust, monotype prints, and collaged elements to create a surface that is richly textured through many layers of beeswax. Her iterative journey began when a friend gave her some rusted metal pieces in flower shapes. With a roll of her eyes that said, “I don’t do flowers,” she nevertheless began to imagine ways to make the motif her own. Printing the rusted objects on paper, and using walnut and India inks on Kozopapers, she began to add patterns, then to overlap and layer elements, until the motif was less a flower and more a shape and texture to incorporate into her many-layered abstractions.\r\n\r\nVorm’s use of Martin’s “layer” motif in some of her pieces was a nod to the collaborative spirit the two artists developed over the five months of working together.","date":"November 8, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4785884e+12,"url":"http://visualarts.utah.gov","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"fcfbf7a7c99b43b3ae083fc0c9e6f4c3","lat":40.769640778151725,"lng":-111.87347173446753,"active":true,"__v":0}

Watsky, performing with his live band Creme Fraiche, puts on a dynamic live performance that has earned him festival slots at San Francisco’s Outside Lands, Bumbershoot in Seattle, Rock the Bells, the Wireless Festival in London, and the 2014 Van’s Warped Tour, among many other stops in a young career that has already tallied nearly a thousand shows.\r\nTickets: $18 ADV / $20 DOS","date":"November 9, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4787432e+12,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/events/305522279787158","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"72f7b022292a450fb439dd36867261f6","lat":40.76774738029294,"lng":-111.90656337750109,"active":true,"__v":0}

Unfortunately, awareness does not always lead to understanding. Public confusion remains about what trans identity is and, just as importantly, what it is not. How long has a transgender community existed? Where does transgender identity originate? What do those who support the transgender community want most?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn this public forum we’ll examine these questions and explore the roots of some of the public confusion by looking at history, culture, and art. We’ll also examine popular beliefs about sex, sexuality, and gender and discuss the role art museums and other public institutions might play to increase understanding. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSession leaders:\r\n\r\n___\r\n**Gabriella Blanchard (She, Her, Hers)**\r\n___\r\nCoordinator of Education and Outreach, University of Utah LGBT Resource Center\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Romeo Jackson (They, Them)\r\n___\r\n**Graduate Teaching Assistant, Gender Justice Scholars, Gender Studies Program\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Whitney Tassie (She, Her, Hers)**\r\n___\r\nUMFA Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**David Hawkins, Ph.D.** **(He, Him, His)**\r\n___\r\nAssistant Professor and Lecturer, University of Utah Department of Writing \u0026 Rhetoric Studies\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nACME (Art.

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 8, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4785884e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"07ea67d27611413f9fb765b1472594f9","lat":40.78046657765774,"lng":-111.89923502948132,"active":true,"__v":0}

He is a native of California but moved to Salt Lake City in July 2013. Mr. Marto grew up in Carmel Valley, CA, so it is no surprise that he gravitated towards wildlife photography. Mountain biking, hiking, tennis, and playing the electric guitar round out the list of pursuits for this U.C. San Diego graduate. He has a beautiful wife and two adorable children.\r\n\r\nPaul’s work has recently been highlighted by *National Geographic*, *USA Today*, *KSL.com*, *Utah.com*, Bolsa Chica Conservancy, Sea \u0026 Sage Audubon Society, The Environmental Nature Center, *Orange County Register*, *Irvine World News*, *Focusingonwildlife.com*, and *WildlifePhotographyNews.net*. He is a recent winner of the City of Irvine's 40th Anniversary Photo Contest and his works have won numerous online photo contests as well.

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 9, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4786748e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"fe671dbed39641a984fbf835e1740474","lat":40.780507018438186,"lng":-111.89914954054437,"active":true,"__v":0}

She reflected on the times she has stopped at that very place, each time with a different travel companion, to snap a picture. Geological layering and erosion became a metaphor for layering and erosion of memory.\r\n\r\n“After three paintings, I set the photo aside and worked from memory,” Martin said. “Without all that detail in front of me, I could select those elements that were most memorable and play with color, line, and texture that expressed the essence of the memory.”\r\n\r\nNancy Vorm’s abstract encaustic paintings incorporate inks, rust, monotype prints, and collaged elements to create a surface that is richly textured through many layers of beeswax. Her iterative journey began when a friend gave her some rusted metal pieces in flower shapes. With a roll of her eyes that said, “I don’t do flowers,” she nevertheless began to imagine ways to make the motif her own. Printing the rusted objects on paper, and using walnut and India inks on Kozopapers, she began to add patterns, then to overlap and layer elements, until the motif was less a flower and more a shape and texture to incorporate into her many-layered abstractions.\r\n\r\nVorm’s use of Martin’s “layer” motif in some of her pieces was a nod to the collaborative spirit the two artists developed over the five months of working together.","date":"November 9, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4786748e+12,"url":"http://visualarts.utah.gov","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"10cf16b461134a438af6b5bc80aee4ff","lat":40.769623046355036,"lng":-111.8734155435038,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each piece inspires the other; a song creates a visual image, a painting comes to\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nlife in video, and a video becomes a work of art. As you walk through the exhibit you are\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ninvited to see and touch the paintings, as well as view each video on a monitor while\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nlistening with earphones to the music. A complete immersion in the creative process and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nthe mind of Jimmi Toro.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nToro says “I believe every piece of art, each video viewed, and every song listened to\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ncan give off a portion of its original emotion to the listener and observer. Of course, this\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nemotional experience can be enhanced by a natural connection to the genre or style of\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nthe art. This emotion becomes even more forceful by combining fine art, music, and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nvideo in a way that influences and creates a relationship from one creative offering to the\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nother. It can additionally be enhanced by understanding the creative thought and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nexecution process that goes into this work. With that said, my hope is that this triad of\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nart, music and video will inspire people to not just understand and appreciate the\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ncreative process more, but cause them to think a little deeper about humanity and our\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nrelationship to each other, hopefully resulting in a little more respect and a little less\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nanger.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nExhibit runs from November 2 nd – November 27 th 2016\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nArtist Reception: November 4 th | 6-9pm\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nGallery Stroll: November 18 th | 6-9pm\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nGallery Hours: Tues – Sat 12-8pm and Sun 12-6pm.

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 9, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4786748e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"ac9fb3380ae5444eaae5743ed8952a2f","lat":40.76836829109416,"lng":-111.8946239293862,"active":true,"__v":0}

One of the world’s great love stories, this ballet is set to Puccini’s sweeping and memorable score, masterfully executed by the Ballet West Orchestra. The timeless story unfolds dramatically with exquisite costumes and picturesque sets, which beautifully evoke the mystery of 19th century Japan.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n*Madame Butterfly* tells the story of the delicate geisha Cio-Cio San who renounces her faith and her family to wed Lieutenant Pinkerton, the handsome but cynical American naval officer who is betrothed to another. The centerpiece of *Madame Butterfly* is a ravishing wedding night pas de deux between Pinkerton and Cio-Cio San, which closes the first act.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nCreated in 1995, *Madame Butterfly *was Houston Ballet Artistic Director Stanton Welch’s first full-length work for The Australian Ballet, and has been performed around the globe many times over.  *The New York Times* praised the ballet calling it, “a vividly compelling piece of dance theater,” and Sydney’s *The Age *raved, “The tragic story of *Madame Butterfly’s* innocent, trusting love and betrayal is vividly portrayed in dance in Stanton Welch’s new creation and is a triumph.” In 2009, when Ballet West staged *Madame Butterfly, *performances sold out and City Weekly’s Scott Renshaw said, “*Madame Butterfly* features breathtaking visuals that will stay with you the day after you attend the ballet, the week after you attend the ballet, even the month after you attend the ballet!”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the production, Ballet West offers *Warm Ups *before each performance*.* These fun and informative discussions with members of the artistic staff are free of charge to ticket holders and begin promptly one-hour prior to each performance*. *Attendees will get insider information on the evening’s program including background on the ballet, information on the choreographer, and other interesting behind-the-scenes facts.

Be the LEAD SINGER of a Live Band with This Is Your Band (TIYB), playing here every Thursday night!  This IS the ONLY Live Band Karaoke in Utah...and once you experience it, you'll never look at Karaoke the same!  They have over 1000 songs to choose from - to view their list, go to thisisyourband.com and download their songlist!  Arrive early to get on the list...it fills up fast and we want to hear YOU sing!  Come early and enjoy one of our delicious dinner entrees and your favorite beverages all night long!  This event is SOOOOO popular that the LIST fills up fast, and we want as many of you to be able to sing every Thursday as possible, so please review the following so we can get as many of you up on stage as possible and to avoid any confusion:   1. You must sign up on the list with our KJ - Paul Woody (PDub). He is the ONLY person that can sign people up to sing. Watch for him to arrive and get your name on the list.  2. You must ALREADY have your song picked out when you ask Paul to sign you up - NO EXCEPTIONS.   3. Paul will announce 3 singers at a time: UP NEXT, ON DECK, and IN THE HOLE. When you are in the ON DECK position, you need to be at the stage BEFORE the current singer completes their song so you can go right up. We need you ready to go when it is your turn to avoid delays which takes singing time away. If you ARE NOT ready to take stage when it is your turn, you will lose your turn and will need ask to get back on the list (at the bottom). NO EXCEPTIONS!  3. DO NOT ask to be bumped up on the list - it will not happen. It is not fair to other singers who have been waiting their turn.  4. If you want to be put on the list again after you have sang, you can sign up immediately after completing your song ONLY.  5. A duet counts as one person's song. If a singer invites you up to sing a duet with them, that WILL NOT count as YOUR song, and you will keep your current place on the list.    It is BEST to arrive early to get your name on the list and get up as quickly as possible. That MAY improve your chance to sing again later in the evening, but is NOT a guarantee.","date":"November 10, 2016","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4788368e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"c2b5e31628304a118110cf8ff7534da8","lat":40.586694503544045,"lng":-111.8955342226757,"active":true,"__v":0}

Geological layering and erosion became a metaphor for layering and erosion of memory.\r\n\r\n“After three paintings, I set the photo aside and worked from memory,” Martin said. “Without all that detail in front of me, I could select those elements that were most memorable and play with color, line, and texture that expressed the essence of the memory.”\r\n\r\nNancy Vorm’s abstract encaustic paintings incorporate inks, rust, monotype prints, and collaged elements to create a surface that is richly textured through many layers of beeswax. Her iterative journey began when a friend gave her some rusted metal pieces in flower shapes. With a roll of her eyes that said, “I don’t do flowers,” she nevertheless began to imagine ways to make the motif her own. Printing the rusted objects on paper, and using walnut and India inks on Kozopapers, she began to add patterns, then to overlap and layer elements, until the motif was less a flower and more a shape and texture to incorporate into her many-layered abstractions.\r\n\r\nVorm’s use of Martin’s “layer” motif in some of her pieces was a nod to the collaborative spirit the two artists developed over the five months of working together.","date":"November 10, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4787612e+12,"url":"http://visualarts.utah.gov","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"217d88e282c24e82abc3df6501c98619","lat":40.76973315143913,"lng":-111.8734043573708,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 10, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4787612e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"4ca49f5920eb48a0acfd418e4c5964db","lat":40.768443764340645,"lng":-111.89469441410928,"active":true,"__v":0}

Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books.

Barlow Fall Civic Leadership Forum, sponsored by the Olene S. Walker Institute of Politics \u0026 Public Service at Weber State University, the WSU student association and WSU Convocations.\r\n___\r\n\r\nThe public is invited to hear Harvard professor, political philosopher and MacArthur Genius recipient Danielle Allen present “Our Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality,” in the Shepherd Union Wildcat Theater, Nov. 11 at 11:30 a.m.\r\n___\r\n\r\nAllen will outline the history of democracy through the framework of the Declaration.  She makes the case that Americans cannot have freedom without equality. Based on extensive research, Allen’s work underscores the significance of America’s founding text, detailing what democracy actually means and what it demands of its citizens.\r\n\r\n“We are fortunate to have professor Allen during a critical juncture in our American history. This election cycle has drawn our nation into a false dichotomy, leaving us to believe that if we have equality that we cannot have liberty, and, conversely, if we have liberty, we cannot have equality,” said Adrienne Andrews, WSU’s chief diversity officer. “I look forward to her ability to work us through this false dilemma and help us understand how these two ideas are critical aspects of our democratic culture and can help us move forward together, using our Declaration of Independence as a guide.” \r\n\r\nWhile teaching the Declaration of Independence to low-income night school students in Chicago, Allen rediscovered the power of the document. Her presentation at WSU will focus on her book, “Our Declaration,” which won the Francis Parkman Prize from the Society of American Historians and the Chicago Tribune’s Heartland Prize for Nonfiction.\r\n\r\nShe is the author of six books, including her most recent, “Education and Equality,” which underscores the importance of education to democratic life and makes a strong case for humanities in education. She also wrote “Talking to Strangers: Anxieties of Citizenship since Brown v. Board of Education.”\r\n\r\nAllen is the director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University as well as a professor in Harvard’s Department of Government and Graduate School Education. She worked on Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign and founded the Civic Knowledge Project to offer university lectures to Chicago’s poor.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the American Academy of Arts \u0026 Sciences and the American Philosophical Society and a 2001 winner of a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.\r\n\r\n“Danielle Allen has dedicated herself to thinking about the relationship between liberty and equality in America,” said Carol McNamara, director of the Walker Institute. “Her work compels us to think about how we can respect and promote both, as critical goals in American democracy through civic education and engagement”\r\n\r\nThe annual event is made possible with the generous support of Haven J. Barlow, whose 42-year stint in the Utah Senate was the longest in state history. This year’s cosponsors include the Walker Institute, WSUSA, Convocations, Diversity and Inclusive Programs, the Department of Political Science \u0026 Philosophy and the College of Social \u0026 Behavioral Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe Walker Institute is a non-partisan center dedicated to promoting leadership and public service among WSU students and in the community. The Walker Institute provides opportunities for civic education, public forums on current issues and ideas for political reform. A robust program of internships in local, state and national politics, and government and public service organizations is central to the Walker Institute mission.\r\n\r\nVisit weber.edu/wsutoday for more news about Weber State University.","date":"November 11, 2016","startTime":"11:30","endTime":"","timeValue":1.478889e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"edcb3ccb1ef94ff58798d2fa4224e965","lat":41.18773799902987,"lng":-111.94750793701722,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each camera records a particular movement or view of her mundane journey. Lucas displays the videos on individual monitors that are part of a larger grouping that overlaps and hover off the wall. This presentation creates an overload of information to consume, making it difficult to focus on any single video as your eye jumps from one monitor to another. The soundtrack includes a monolog written from phrases collected from online product reviews and technical forums discussing everything from system upgrades to biometric feedback. Initially, the narrator sounds excited by the prospect of new technologies, but a feeling of uneasiness slowly becomes apparent as the video progresses.\r\n\r\nLucas challenges the notion that technology, sharing, and connectedness create engaged communities. Instead, this trend of overproducing and oversharing leads to a sense of isolation and disappointment due to the abundance of irrelevant information available online and the way we access it through almost instantly outmoded technologies.\r\n\r\n**About The Artist**\r\n\r\nKristin Lucas was born in 1968 in Davenport, Iowa. She received a B.F.A. from The Cooper Union for Advancement of Science and Art, New York, in 1994, and an M.F.A. from Stanford University in 2006. Lucas has been awarded numerous artist-in-residencies, through the Experimental Television Center in Owego, New York; Marie Walsh Sharpe Studio Space Program; the P.S.1 National Studio Program and Harvestworks, New York; and the ARCUS A.I.R. Program, Ibaraki, Japan, among others. During the summer and fall of 2000, Lucas participated in the World Views residency program on the 91st Floor of the World Trade Center’s Tower 1, where she produced two major site-specific video works.","date":"November 11, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"21:00","timeValue":1.478916e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"5f0d9435214043b0a42a57fe9c23c9fd","lat":40.76845535011352,"lng":-111.89452258306233,"active":true,"__v":0}

The timeless story unfolds dramatically with exquisite costumes and picturesque sets, which beautifully evoke the mystery of 19th century Japan.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n*Madame Butterfly* tells the story of the delicate geisha Cio-Cio San who renounces her faith and her family to wed Lieutenant Pinkerton, the handsome but cynical American naval officer who is betrothed to another.

Her eidetic memory, the adrenaline rush, and the calling to help people was in her blood. But after her latest mission in Paris and her confrontation with a terrorist, Alex begins to question her role working for The Company, a secret spy organization that exists in the basement of Brown University.\r\n\r\nWhen the CIA asks for her assistance on a mission only she has the ability to complete, Alex agrees to travel to Mexico City as an exchange student at an elite art school, leaving behind her comatose brother and her handler who has risked everything to keep her safe and would do anything to be with her.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to prove to herself where she belongs, Alex throws herself into the mission, only to discover that her training may not be enough. As her perspective changes, she begins to realize that her memory isn't a canvas of realistic paint strokes, but an impressionistic landscape influenced by her own emotions. Scaling buildings and discovering secrets may not be as hard as finding her own heart.

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"On **November 11** and **12**, at 7:30 PM in Abravanel Hall, the Utah Symphony is proud to welcome internationally-acclaimed guest artist **Alexander Gavrylyuk** in his Utah Symphony debut, performing Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 with the orchestra led by Music Director **Thierry Fischer**. This rousing performance combines the courage and conviction of Brahms’ Symphony No. 3 along with the grand opening chords and exuberant outbursts of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1. In addition to the continuation of the Brahms' symphony cycle, Fischer resumes the Ives symphony cycle with Ives’ Symphony No. 3, “The Camp Meeting,” for which Ives won the Pulitzer Prize in 1947.\r\n\r\nAudiences can expect to hear a characteristically Romantic era spirit of heroic rebellion in Tchaikovsky’sConcerto No. 1 for piano and orchestra. It bursts upon us with an opening that is explosive and iconic: a moment of brassy orchestral fanfare introducing thunderous piano chords grouped in threes. They are played in unison with both hands as they move in bold, multi-octave leaps up the keyboard. From soloist  Alexander Gavrylyuk, the audience will hear a modern-day interpreter who puts his personal stamp on one of the great concertos of the piano repertory.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1984, Alexander Gavrylyuk began his piano studies at the age of seven and gave his first concerto performance when he was nine years old. He has won many prestigious awards including First Prize and Gold Medal at the 1999 Horowitz International Piano Competition, First Prize at the Hamamatsu International Piano Competition in Japan in 2000, where the Japanese press lauded him as the “most talented 16 year-old pianist of the second half of the 20th Century,” and both the coveted Gold Medal as well as the award for Best Performance of a Classical Concerto at the internationally renowned Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Masters Competition. He is now increasingly in demand by orchestras and conductors for his noble and compelling interpretations. He has appeared with, among others, the Philharmonic Orchestras of New York, Los Angeles, Warsaw, Moscow, Israel and Rotterdam as well as the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Bournemouth Symphony, Stuttgarter Philharmoniker, the Netherlands Philharmonic, San Antonio Symphony, Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana, Brussels Philharmonic, the Vancouver Symphony and the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Philharmonic Orchestra.\r\n\r\n**RELATED EVENTS \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**A pre-concert lecture, free to all ticket holders, will take place at all Masterworks Series performances in Abravanel Hall’s 1st Tier Room 45 minutes prior to the performance.","date":"November 11, 2016","startTime":"19:30","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4789178e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"697cf22563e943d0b6c29d15925810de","lat":40.76871184464877,"lng":-111.89518503029187,"active":true,"__v":0}

However, once he had earned his spot in the New York All State Orchestra, he felt he had gone as far as he wanted to with the violin. He wanted something new. “Originally my parents didn’t want me to listen to anything except for traditional Bengali and classical music – they were afraid I’d lose my roots. But by the time I was a teenager, they became accepting of American music, and I began my exploration.”\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn 2011, Saha started that exploration under the monicker No Pets Allowed. Within a few years, his mashups and bootleg remixes began to generate attention, quickly rising within the internet music community. However, at the top of 2014, Saha decided to part ways with the project and start something new. “I realized I wanted to make music forever, and I didn’t want to leave my legacy with a name like No Pets Allowed. I didn’t want to be boxed into making dubstep or EDM in general. I wanted to make authentic music that would last forever.”\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWith the momentum generated through his previous project, Saha dove head first into the Jai Wolf project. Within the first few months, the project began to land a string of official remix opportunities throughout 2014 for established artists including Melanie Martinez, Dirty South, Alesso and ODESZA – each remix landing the #1 spot on Hype Machine (an organic, internet version of Billboard’s Top 100). His biggest break came in late 2014 when Skrillex put the official stamp on one of Jai Wolf’s bootlegs. “Skrillex has always been one of my biggest inspirations. I had messaged him the remix, but I didn’t actually expect him to hear it. Next thing I know, someone tweets out that Skrillex dropped my remix at Glastonbury festival and soon after he signs it to Owsla.”\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nSoon after, Jai Wolf began to perform across the country with some consistency, including a debut festival performance at Coachella. In the summer of 2015, Jai Wolf released his debut single Indian Summer through ODESZA’s label Foreign Family Collective.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n“The success of Indian Summer has been so incredibly humbling. It’s the first time I’ve created a track where I was completely true to myself.” Saha’s journey from classical music to electronic music, and from No Pets Allowed to Jai Wolf is a compelling example of growth and success. “It took me a while, but I finally feel comfortable making the music that I’ve always wanted to make.”\r\n\r\nJerry Folk\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nUpon his impending exit from his teenage years, Norway-bred 19-year-old DJ/producer, Jerry Folk, has been organically developing an impressively substantial following through his innate ability to surprise fans each time he releases one of his eclectic productions. Remixing the likes of Baby Bash, Oh Wonder, Chromeo, ZZ Ward and already taking a turn with an original production, the rising talent has accrued millions of plays on his SoundCloud artist page and has already seen support from fellow Norwegian superstars Kygo and Lindstrøm.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nJerry Folk creatively instills his signature blend of indie, disco, funk, R\u0026B, and house in a captivating, yet sophisticated, manner with every release he touches, and demonstrates a trend of versatility across his catalog of musical outputs. While he continues moving forward at the pinnacle of dance newcomers destined for success, Jerry Folk presents an example of a young talent with proven production techniques well beyond his years, and he continues to disregard the barriers of genre labels in an attempt to further develop his indicative style.","date":"November 11, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4789196e+12,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/events/1213020298721949","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"a59edf2f4a794623a5daf9246ee99af3","lat":40.76380610790943,"lng":-111.87572838353633,"active":true,"__v":0}

South Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"A new exhibition, *Iterations, *will be on view at the Alice Gallery Sept. 16 –Nov. 11, 2016. The exhibition features artwork by Utah artists Sue Martin and Nancy Vorm.\r\n\r\n Inspired by artists past and present who are known for iterations (Cezanne, Monet, and Jasper Johns, to name a few), Sue Martin and Nancy Vorm give viewers a glimpse into their creative processes, both intensely introspective and playful.\r\n\r\nSue Martin selected a single photograph taken on a trip to Zion National Park in February. She reflected on the times she has stopped at that very place, each time with a different travel companion, to snap a picture. Geological layering and erosion became a metaphor for layering and erosion of memory.\r\n\r\n“After three paintings, I set the photo aside and worked from memory,” Martin said. “Without all that detail in front of me, I could select those elements that were most memorable and play with color, line, and texture that expressed the essence of the memory.”\r\n\r\nNancy Vorm’s abstract encaustic paintings incorporate inks, rust, monotype prints, and collaged elements to create a surface that is richly textured through many layers of beeswax. Her iterative journey began when a friend gave her some rusted metal pieces in flower shapes. With a roll of her eyes that said, “I don’t do flowers,” she nevertheless began to imagine ways to make the motif her own. Printing the rusted objects on paper, and using walnut and India inks on Kozopapers, she began to add patterns, then to overlap and layer elements, until the motif was less a flower and more a shape and texture to incorporate into her many-layered abstractions.\r\n\r\nVorm’s use of Martin’s “layer” motif in some of her pieces was a nod to the collaborative spirit the two artists developed over the five months of working together.","date":"November 11, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4788476e+12,"url":"http://visualarts.utah.gov","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"2bb098d17fa54265adea5b1cb6741b96","lat":40.7696487150644,"lng":-111.87343896837982,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 11, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4788476e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"64d40e997ade4f9a892cc887291a9e38","lat":40.7683829764867,"lng":-111.89463393291796,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 11, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4788476e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"9e431ee3ac304736af907c9c1c8efdc5","lat":40.780469228314196,"lng":-111.89915280730358,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each camera records a particular movement or view of her mundane journey. Lucas displays the videos on individual monitors that are part of a larger grouping that overlaps and hover off the wall. This presentation creates an overload of information to consume, making it difficult to focus on any single video as your eye jumps from one monitor to another. The soundtrack includes a monolog written from phrases collected from online product reviews and technical forums discussing everything from system upgrades to biometric feedback. Initially, the narrator sounds excited by the prospect of new technologies, but a feeling of uneasiness slowly becomes apparent as the video progresses.\r\n\r\nLucas challenges the notion that technology, sharing, and connectedness create engaged communities. Instead, this trend of overproducing and oversharing leads to a sense of isolation and disappointment due to the abundance of irrelevant information available online and the way we access it through almost instantly outmoded technologies.\r\n\r\n**About The Artist**\r\n\r\nKristin Lucas was born in 1968 in Davenport, Iowa. She received a B.F.A. from The Cooper Union for Advancement of Science and Art, New York, in 1994, and an M.F.A. from Stanford University in 2006. Lucas has been awarded numerous artist-in-residencies, through the Experimental Television Center in Owego, New York; Marie Walsh Sharpe Studio Space Program; the P.S.1 National Studio Program and Harvestworks, New York; and the ARCUS A.I.R. Program, Ibaraki, Japan, among others. During the summer and fall of 2000, Lucas participated in the World Views residency program on the 91st Floor of the World Trade Center’s Tower 1, where she produced two major site-specific video works.","date":"November 11, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4788476e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"4209a061ef0c48f38005d2c17cacc0e5","lat":40.76835485729192,"lng":-111.8946606845581,"active":true,"__v":0}

As you walk through the exhibit you are\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ninvited to see and touch the paintings, as well as view each video on a monitor while\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nlistening with earphones to the music. A complete immersion in the creative process and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nthe mind of Jimmi Toro.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nToro says “I believe every piece of art, each video viewed, and every song listened to\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ncan give off a portion of its original emotion to the listener and observer. Of course, this\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nemotional experience can be enhanced by a natural connection to the genre or style of\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nthe art. This emotion becomes even more forceful by combining fine art, music, and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nvideo in a way that influences and creates a relationship from one creative offering to the\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nother. It can additionally be enhanced by understanding the creative thought and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nexecution process that goes into this work. With that said, my hope is that this triad of\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nart, music and video will inspire people to not just understand and appreciate the\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ncreative process more, but cause them to think a little deeper about humanity and our\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nrelationship to each other, hopefully resulting in a little more respect and a little less\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nanger.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nExhibit runs from November 2 nd – November 27 th 2016\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nArtist Reception: November 4 th | 6-9pm\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nGallery Stroll: November 18 th | 6-9pm\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nGallery Hours: Tues – Sat 12-8pm and Sun 12-6pm.

The timeless story unfolds dramatically with exquisite costumes and picturesque sets, which beautifully evoke the mystery of 19th century Japan.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n*Madame Butterfly* tells the story of the delicate geisha Cio-Cio San who renounces her faith and her family to wed Lieutenant Pinkerton, the handsome but cynical American naval officer who is betrothed to another.

The timeless story unfolds dramatically with exquisite costumes and picturesque sets, which beautifully evoke the mystery of 19th century Japan.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n*Madame Butterfly* tells the story of the delicate geisha Cio-Cio San who renounces her faith and her family to wed Lieutenant Pinkerton, the handsome but cynical American naval officer who is betrothed to another. The centerpiece of *Madame Butterfly* is a ravishing wedding night pas de deux between Pinkerton and Cio-Cio San, which closes the first act.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nCreated in 1995, *Madame Butterfly *was Houston Ballet Artistic Director Stanton Welch’s first full-length work for The Australian Ballet, and has been performed around the globe many times over.  *The New York Times* praised the ballet calling it, “a vividly compelling piece of dance theater,” and Sydney’s *The Age *raved, “The tragic story of *Madame Butterfly’s* innocent, trusting love and betrayal is vividly portrayed in dance in Stanton Welch’s new creation and is a triumph.” In 2009, when Ballet West staged *Madame Butterfly, *performances sold out and City Weekly’s Scott Renshaw said, “*Madame Butterfly* features breathtaking visuals that will stay with you the day after you attend the ballet, the week after you attend the ballet, even the month after you attend the ballet!”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the production, Ballet West offers *Warm Ups *before each performance*.* These fun and informative discussions with members of the artistic staff are free of charge to ticket holders and begin promptly one-hour prior to each performance*. *Attendees will get insider information on the evening’s program including background on the ballet, information on the choreographer, and other interesting behind-the-scenes facts.

This rousing performance combines the courage and conviction of Brahms’ Symphony No. 3 along with the grand opening chords and exuberant outbursts of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1. In addition to the continuation of the Brahms' symphony cycle, Fischer resumes the Ives symphony cycle with Ives’ Symphony No. 3, “The Camp Meeting,” for which Ives won the Pulitzer Prize in 1947.\r\n\r\nAudiences can expect to hear a characteristically Romantic era spirit of heroic rebellion in Tchaikovsky’sConcerto No. 1 for piano and orchestra. It bursts upon us with an opening that is explosive and iconic: a moment of brassy orchestral fanfare introducing thunderous piano chords grouped in threes. They are played in unison with both hands as they move in bold, multi-octave leaps up the keyboard. From soloist  Alexander Gavrylyuk, the audience will hear a modern-day interpreter who puts his personal stamp on one of the great concertos of the piano repertory.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1984, Alexander Gavrylyuk began his piano studies at the age of seven and gave his first concerto performance when he was nine years old. He has won many prestigious awards including First Prize and Gold Medal at the 1999 Horowitz International Piano Competition, First Prize at the Hamamatsu International Piano Competition in Japan in 2000, where the Japanese press lauded him as the “most talented 16 year-old pianist of the second half of the 20th Century,” and both the coveted Gold Medal as well as the award for Best Performance of a Classical Concerto at the internationally renowned Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Masters Competition. He is now increasingly in demand by orchestras and conductors for his noble and compelling interpretations. He has appeared with, among others, the Philharmonic Orchestras of New York, Los Angeles, Warsaw, Moscow, Israel and Rotterdam as well as the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Bournemouth Symphony, Stuttgarter Philharmoniker, the Netherlands Philharmonic, San Antonio Symphony, Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana, Brussels Philharmonic, the Vancouver Symphony and the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Philharmonic Orchestra.\r\n\r\n**RELATED EVENTS \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**A pre-concert lecture, free to all ticket holders, will take place at all Masterworks Series performances in Abravanel Hall’s 1st Tier Room 45 minutes prior to the performance.","date":"November 12, 2016","startTime":"19:30","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4790042e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"387b44eb7d6741938aead9471e5f0bb0","lat":40.76866256309838,"lng":-111.8952023384014,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 12, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.478934e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"87d7ac730dd14e0e9bc71b6faa38f0cc","lat":40.76830452509647,"lng":-111.89459340056334,"active":true,"__v":0}

By reimagining art historical notions of form, space, and process, the artists presented in *Object[ed]: Shaping Sculpture in Contemporary Art* cleverly and skillfully illuminate the realms between painting and sculpture, objectivity and subjectivity, as well as production and consumption. \r\n\r\nArtist List: Olga Balema, Caitlin Cherry, Lizze Määttälä, Leeza Meksin, Tove Storch, Gili Tal","date":"November 12, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.478934e+12,"url":"http://www.utahmoca.org/portfolio/objected/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"13d37947e50a42fb80a9ed349ccedcdd","lat":40.76849319337641,"lng":-111.89458272467782,"active":true,"__v":0}

My pieces represent a place, moment, or an experience that I try to capture. Through my own photographs, a loved one’s photo, or an image that evokes an emotion, each painting has a place and time connected to it. My artwork tells the story of my life. It takes me back to the place where my grandfather spent his last weeks, where my husband learned to love people in a distant land, where a close cousin and friend had a baby, and sometimes to where I find beauty in the least expected places. By creating a permanent image on canvas, I am able to share with others a perspective from a corner of my mind where love, inspiration, and light reside.","date":"November 12, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.478934e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"f27968e699a94e9d9a170be508ed6c11","lat":40.74439553864615,"lng":-111.83008031771219,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 12, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.478934e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"4bfcbd921b7d4fd98f8b71d6b3fb6116","lat":40.780602532724075,"lng":-111.89919097698191,"active":true,"__v":0}

One of the world’s great love stories, this ballet is set to Puccini’s sweeping and memorable score, masterfully executed by the Ballet West Orchestra. The timeless story unfolds dramatically with exquisite costumes and picturesque sets, which beautifully evoke the mystery of 19th century Japan.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n*Madame Butterfly* tells the story of the delicate geisha Cio-Cio San who renounces her faith and her family to wed Lieutenant Pinkerton, the handsome but cynical American naval officer who is betrothed to another. The centerpiece of *Madame Butterfly* is a ravishing wedding night pas de deux between Pinkerton and Cio-Cio San, which closes the first act.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nCreated in 1995, *Madame Butterfly *was Houston Ballet Artistic Director Stanton Welch’s first full-length work for The Australian Ballet, and has been performed around the globe many times over.  *The New York Times* praised the ballet calling it, “a vividly compelling piece of dance theater,” and Sydney’s *The Age *raved, “The tragic story of *Madame Butterfly’s* innocent, trusting love and betrayal is vividly portrayed in dance in Stanton Welch’s new creation and is a triumph.” In 2009, when Ballet West staged *Madame Butterfly, *performances sold out and City Weekly’s Scott Renshaw said, “*Madame Butterfly* features breathtaking visuals that will stay with you the day after you attend the ballet, the week after you attend the ballet, even the month after you attend the ballet!”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the production, Ballet West offers *Warm Ups *before each performance*.* These fun and informative discussions with members of the artistic staff are free of charge to ticket holders and begin promptly one-hour prior to each performance*. *Attendees will get insider information on the evening’s program including background on the ballet, information on the choreographer, and other interesting behind-the-scenes facts.

At age 17, Nina and the band performed at New York's Knitting Factory as part of a taping for a television show. Joan Jett was in attendance and was so impressed, that she signed GIAC to her label, Blackheart Records, on the spot. The band's 2007 debut album, Both Before I'm Gone, was a critical hit with raves from Alternative Press Magazine, the LA Weekly, Bust magazine, among many others, with the album reaching No. 23 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart and No. 21 on iTunes. Girl in a Coma went on to release three more albums and toured the world opening for bands such as Sia, Smashing Pumpkins, Morrissey, Tegan and Sara, Amanda Palmer and many more. The band's most recent album Exits \u0026 All the Rest was named to NPR's 50 Favorite Albums of the Year.\r\nNina's distinctive voice and powerful live performances attracted\r\nthe attention of fans, producers and fellow artists. Nina collaborated with Tiësto to co-write the dance track, \"In Your Mind.\" Director Robert Rodriguez is such a fan of the band that he not only filmed an impromptu music video when he first saw them perform at SXSW, but also asked Nina Diaz and the band to compose a song for the climactic fight scene in his movie, Machete.\r\nBeing a public performer at such an early age took a toll and Nina began finding an outlet as she began writing new material that was all her own. Nina launched her new solo project with a series of live concerts at The Belmont in Austin, Texas. On the first night of the residency,\r\nNina fronted a five-piece band and performed this new material to a sold out crowd. Since then she has performed to sold out crowds throughout Texas as well as at Maverick Music Festival, Fiesta de la Flor, The Austin Music Awards and opening weekend at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts. Her backing band, hand-picked by Nina to highlight her new sound, includes Jorge Gonzalez (drums), Johnny Shrink (keys), Austin Valentine (bass), and Travis Vela (guitar).\r\nNina Diaz's solo debut album is scheduled to be released later this year.\r\nTickets: $10","date":"November 14, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4791752e+12,"host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"5bbcfbaa8b104c99bf09fd9a4767cadf","lat":40.753114905447376,"lng":-111.90079611800117,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 14, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4791068e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"a5ae3c6958d94858be2dd910f729ea68","lat":40.780549181108924,"lng":-111.89922482848284,"active":true,"__v":0}

ArtTix is the only official ticketing source for the Zions Bank Broadway at the Eccles series and The Eccles Theater.\r\n___\r\nBEAUTIFUL tells the inspiring true story of King’s remarkable rise to stardom, from being part of a hit songwriting team with her husband Gerry Goffin, to her relationship with fellow writers and best friends Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, to becoming one of the most successful solo acts in popular music history. Along the way, she made more than beautiful music, she wrote the soundtrack to a generation.\r\n\r\nLong before she was Carole King, chart-topping music legend, she was Carol Klein, Brooklyn girl with passion and chutzpah. She fought her way into the record business as a teenager and, by the time she reached her twenties, had the husband of her dreams and a flourishing career writing hits for the biggest acts in rock ‘n’ roll. But it wasn’t until her personal life began to crack that she finally managed to find her true voice.\r\n\r\nFeaturing a stunning array of beloved songs written by Gerry Goffin/Carole King and Barry Mann/Cynthia Weil, including “I Feel The Earth Move,” “One Fine Day,” “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” “You’ve Got A Friend” and the title song, BEAUTIFUL has a book by Tony® Award-nominee and Academy® Award-nominated writer Douglas McGrath, direction by Marc Bruni, choreography by Josh Prince and took home two 2014 Tony® Awards and the 2015 Grammy® for Best Musical Theater Album.

Acid-test heaviness is Night Beats’ currency, but this is no out-right nostalgia trip either. Instead of Nixon and Vietnam, Night Beats have their own epoch of God and guns and bombs and drones to rail against…or flee from. Besides, bad vibrations, blues jams and id-shattering explorations are timeless pursuits – why shouldn’t today’s young generation be allowed to take a ride down the slippery spiral that sits within the centre of each of us?\r\n___\r\nOn their third album – and first for Heavenly Recordings — Night Beats perhaps most recall their Texan forefathers and psyche-rock originators 13th Floor Elevators at their ‘69 peak, just before The Man busted young Roky Erickson and dragged him to the psyche ward for barbaric doses of shock treatment. These boys represent the best of the Lone Star State’s flipside – that vast dusty hinterland of the soul where it’s easy to drift off the map and reinvent yourself as part of the long lineage of creative cowboys who prefer psychotropics to rodeo riding, guitars rather than firearms.\r\n___\r\n“Old cowboy culture is alive and well in Texas,” says frontman Danny Lee Blackwell. “I grew up with Texan mythology all around us, so as a band its instilled in our blood. My Dad didn’t wrangle steers but he did pick cotton when he was young. But then cities like Austin and Dallas, where we spent most of our time growing up, have a real sense of musical history that runs deep, so we feed off legacy that too.”\r\n___\r\nFrom the Elevators and The Red Krayola on to pre-ZZ Top band The Moving Sidewalks, Butthole Surfers and The Black Angels – whose record label Reverb Appreciation Society have released Night Beats — and a clutch of other early cult bands besides (Bubble Puppy, Shiva’s Headband and the Golden Dawn, anyone?), Texas has always been a prime breeding ground for such outlaw music. “The Elevators were one of the reasons I decided to become a singer and form the group,” says Blackwell. “I loved their attempt to play R ‘n’ B music, but from a distinctly Texan approach. I’d say they have profoundly influenced the group, but it’s now our job to take it to another level in a new age.”\r\n___\r\nIt took a cross-country relocation to instigate their formation. Night Beats were born when frontman Danny Lee Blackwell upped stick from Dallas to Seattle, Washington and was soon joined by childhood friend James Traeger. “James got me a copy of Ginsberg’s Howl when I was around 15 and it changed everything,” remembers Blackwell of his old friend. “We grew up together and once he moved up to Seattle we did everything together there too. I wanted to try out a different place, a new city, where no one knew my music and there wasn’t anything remotely similar going on. Coming from Dallas, Austin seemed like the obvious choice but I needed something more. Seattle was at one time the home to people we love like Ray Charles, Jimi Hendrix and Quincy Jones so I didn’t feel too disconnected.”\r\n___\r\nThe two existed initially as a guitar and drums duo, named in honour of Sam Cooke’s 1963 album Night Beat, before fellow Jakob Bowden Dallas resident joined on bass after a stint in Austin. Filtering a collective love of pioneering artists as disparate as Buddy Holly, Fela Kuti, Etta James, James Brown and Leonard Cohen, Night Beats dropped a clutch of singles, split-singles, cassette release and two albums – their self-titled debut in 2011 followed by Sonic Bloom in 2013 – as well as featuring on all manner of compilation albums that document the cutting edge of the head-bending, modern counter-cultural US underground.\r\n___\r\nNight Beats hit the road too, touring extensively with Roky Erickson, The Zombies, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Strange Boys, Black Lips, The Growlers and The Black Angels in North America, Europe, Israel, South Africa and Australia.\r\n___\r\nRecorded on old two-inch tape in Echo Park, Los Angeles at the home of producer Nic Jodoin and featuring co-production and guess bass playing from Robert Levon Been of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, new album Who Sold My Generation goes beyond merely being a retreading of well-worn garage / R\u0026B path. Instead it offers a contemporary take on the psychedelic experience, a heady set of hoodoo voodoo songs. Mordant and corrosive opener ‘Celebration #1’ sets the tone with its wailing guitar jams and Messiah-like monologue, while ‘No Cops’ makes like the imaginary soundtrack to an orgiastic party somewhere in the LA hills as the summer of love gave way to an era of greed and paranoia. ‘Sunday Mourning’ is the sound of blood dripping on the twitching remains of a generation’s super ego and with a rockabilly strut, ‘Egypt Berry’ chases the White Rabbit down into a cosmic underworld while shaking its burning tail feathers\r\n___\r\nWith new Who Sold My Generation, Night Beats have not only painted it black, they’ve torched the fucker and driven it off the cliff, crashing and burning into the arid canyon below.\r\n___\r\nIn its afterglow only the lone howl of a solitary coyote remains.\r\n\r\nThe Mystery Lights\r\n\r\nFacebook\r\n\r\nMike Brandon and L.A. Solano have been in many different versions of The Mystery Lights under assorted monikers since their teens. In a heroic jump from the small town of Salinas, California to NYC, the band solidified its lineup to also include Alex Amini, Kevin Harris, and Noah Kohll.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThe explosive live shows gradually became the stuff of legend, as the quintet won their following one fan at a time in dives from Brooklyn to the Bowery. Organically unfolding over the nights months and years, the Lights’ sound has evolved into a fuzz-fueled hopped-up 21st Century take on 60s garage pebbles, and artful 70s punk, that is all their own. 2016 finds these rock’n’roll knights embarking upon the next logical step - unleashing their own brand of kick out the jams on tour and in the studio.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWhen Daptone Records launched their Wick Records rock imprint, they wasted no time approaching Mystery Lights as their inaugural act. Hot on the heels of the \"Too Many Girls\"/\"Too Tough To Bear\" single, Wick officially rolls out the Mystery Lights’ debut LP, recorded at Daptone Records' House of Soul studio, on June 24.

And, not surprisingly, the more popular ones are the acts that are most authentic. Such is the case with Cash’d Out, a San Diego based band, that channels Johnny Cash in about as close a manner to the real thing as it gets. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nHow can you tell?\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWell, beyond critics having anointed Cash’d Out (Douglas Benson on vocals, Kevin Manuel on guitar, Ryan Thomas on bass and George Bernardo on drums) the “next best thing to Johnny Cash,” and the group having won four San Diego Music Awards for Best Tribute Band, the real proof lies in what members of Cash’s inner circle have said. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n“Cindy Cash came to a show, we made her cry and she gave me a necklace with Johnny's hair in a glass locket,” explains front man and Cash impersonator Douglas Benson. Benson added that Cash producer Lou Robin has also been to several Cash’d Out shows, and claimed that if he closed it eyes it was like “going back in time.”\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nOnce the only tribute band endorsed by the official Johnny Cash web page, JohnnyCash.com, Cash’d Out has played to over 1.2 million fans since forming in 2005. And those fans continually tell the group how grateful they are that Cash’d Out continues to bring back memories of loved ones who once raised them on the music of Johnny Cash. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nW.S. Holland, Cash’s longtime drummer, even sat in with Cash’d Out at a birthday celebration for Johnny Cash hosted by Bill and Shannon Miller of JohnnyCash.com at the Fender Museum in Corona, California. “And (noted Cash historian) Bill Miller let me play Johnny’s cherry sunburst Guild guitar,” added Benson. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nCash'd Out has over 150 of JC's songs in their repertoire, and can deliver up to four hours of non-stop entertainment, including the June Carter Cash duets brought back to fame in the Oscar winning film, Walk the Line. Cash'd Out also tailors performances to suit any venue or function -- from clubs, theaters, fairs and casinos to museums and corporate events.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThe band’s live shows respectfully reference the late, great Man in Black's Sun Records and early Columbia era sound, combined with the energy of the classic multi-platinum live recordings from Folsom Prison and San Quentin. The group's genuine love (and authentic recreation) of Johnny Cash’s music and its universal appeal fans of all ages and of virtually all musical genres makes each Cash’d Out show a must-see event.\r\n\r\nThe Delta Bombers\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nThe Delta Bombers have smashed stages all over the world since 2008 with no plans of stopping. Started by four teenagers in Las Vegas, they’re driven by a hybrid of 50’s rock and roll fused with blues and the most exciting elements of rockabilly. The band’s haunting but powerful voice Chris Moinichen constantly keeps the songs fresh. Andrew Himmler on guitar often drives the songs with guitar singes while Greg Garcia on Stand-up Bass and Kirk Highberger on Drums sway the dynamic of the band up and down. The Delta Bombers continue to take on month long tours of new and distant places such as Russia and the Czech Republic supported by four studio albums including their newest self-titled album “The Delta Bombers” (2014). The Bombers have played some of the most renowned Rockabilly and Psychobilly festivals including Viva Las Vegas, Psychobilly Meeting (Spain), Rockalavera (Mexico), Sjock (Belgium) and High Rockabilly (Spain). What started as a teenage dream has now come to fruition as a worldwide rock and roll expedition, one that should be witnessed by anyone who considers themselves a fan of music!

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 15, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4791932e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"4709bd727bce4b95aabb51295c1cbea4","lat":40.768403512030545,"lng":-111.8946705389894,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 15, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4791932e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"317a712ee9e0422c9323af58229cc3b3","lat":40.780608732802804,"lng":-111.89921633343177,"active":true,"__v":0}

The clucking chickens and drying laundry are somewhat unusual genre elements for the artist, and along with the flawlessly blue sky draw the viewing into one of the most captivating images Stewart ever painted.

Her pioneering sculptures, using latex, fiberglass, and plastics, helped establish the post-minimalist movement. Dying of a brain tumor at age 34, she had a mere decade-long career that, despite its brevity, is dense with complex, intriguing works that defy easy categorization. *Eva Hesse*, the first feature-length appreciation of her life and work, makes superb use of the artist’s voluminous journals, her correspondence with close friend and mentor Sol LeWitt, and contemporary as well as archival interviews with fellow artists (among them, Richard Serra, Robert Mangold, Dan Graham) who recall her passionate, ambitious, tenacious personality. Art critic Arthur Danto has written that her work is “full of life, of eros, even of comedy… Each piece vibrates with originality and mischief.” The documentary captures these qualities, but also the psychic struggles of an artist who, in the downtown New York art scene of the 1960s, was one of the few women to make work that was taken seriously in a field dominated by male pop artists and minimalists.","date":"November 16, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.479348e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"bf6bde93fa1f45d29a6ee22884cb96f9","lat":40.7602294,"lng":-111.8433477,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 16, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4792796e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"8f407955008b4a1591049e1a91ec677a","lat":40.76834805999754,"lng":-111.89455289727715,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 16, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4792796e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"155fbfe135714b12b5876211582506f4","lat":40.78059481658006,"lng":-111.89915611342032,"active":true,"__v":0}

ArtTix is the only official ticketing source for the Zions Bank Broadway at the Eccles series and The Eccles Theater.\r\n___\r\nBEAUTIFUL tells the inspiring true story of King’s remarkable rise to stardom, from being part of a hit songwriting team with her husband Gerry Goffin, to her relationship with fellow writers and best friends Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, to becoming one of the most successful solo acts in popular music history. Along the way, she made more than beautiful music, she wrote the soundtrack to a generation.\r\n\r\nLong before she was Carole King, chart-topping music legend, she was Carol Klein, Brooklyn girl with passion and chutzpah. She fought her way into the record business as a teenager and, by the time she reached her twenties, had the husband of her dreams and a flourishing career writing hits for the biggest acts in rock ‘n’ roll. But it wasn’t until her personal life began to crack that she finally managed to find her true voice.\r\n\r\nFeaturing a stunning array of beloved songs written by Gerry Goffin/Carole King and Barry Mann/Cynthia Weil, including “I Feel The Earth Move,” “One Fine Day,” “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” “You’ve Got A Friend” and the title song, BEAUTIFUL has a book by Tony® Award-nominee and Academy® Award-nominated writer Douglas McGrath, direction by Marc Bruni, choreography by Josh Prince and took home two 2014 Tony® Awards and the 2015 Grammy® for Best Musical Theater Album. BEAUTIFUL is currently playing to sold out crowds at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre on Broadway.\r\n\r\n*Captioned performance for this show is Saturday, November 19th at 2:00PM.

High expectations are a given now, seven years since those first EPs began their slow burn from Sydney to the world; four since PRISONER scooped the Australian Music Prize and set stages ablaze from Splendour to Lollapalooza\\.\r\n\"What's it gonna be? Maybe it's a broken heart\\.\"\r\nYeah, they know that feeling too, after the turmoil of illness and dislocation surrounding their aptly titled second album, THE BRINK\\. Don't even ask\\. Just cue a second \\#2 debut and another spectacular global onslaught\\. \r\nWhat's a band to do? The answer is short but loaded to the teeth\\. SYNTHIA\\. \r\nThe title gets Hayley Mary talking in pictures as big as the music itself\\. From the Greek goddess of the moon to '80s synth\\-pop goddess Cyndi Lauper\\. From The Heroine's Journey to the rock world's simplistic perception of the synthetic feminine versus the authentic male\\.\r\nAll that's between the lines, of course\\. The Jezabels didn't choose their biblical namesake at random when Hayley and Heather met Sam and Nik at Sydney Uni almost a decade ago\\. Their deeply felt gender agenda has only grown more potent and personal as the world bends slowly to its fury\\.\r\nHere their Trojan horse of big, cinematic rock has escalated in scale\\. With PRISONER producer Lachlan Mitchell back at the desk and Heather's growing arsenal of new and vintage keyboards pushing the textural frontier, SYNTHIA is a bold assertion of craft that sets this band apart in a world groaning with blokes doing their best impersonation of rock authenticity\\. \r\n\"Heather had a couple of new synthesisers, so a lot of ideas were coming from her and then we'd build the songs around them,\" Hayley says\\. \"We were back in Sydney \\[from London\\] in January, we just got together to rehearse and we wrote about four songs in a week\\.\r\n\"This is a record we made ourselves, at our own behest,\" she says significantly\\. \"People were actually surprised when they heard it was happening\\. We were surprised\\. We just had a natural momentum\\.\" \r\n\"The sound keeps growing,\" says Mitchell, who witnessed the songs' evolution over nearly seven months in the studio\\. \"Sam's guitar has transformed into this big, cinematic thing enveloped by effects and washes… Nik is the guy that gives the power and the intricacy to all of that\\. He's always time\\-shifting, thinking up new parts to suit the big picture\\.\" \r\nSYNTHIA plays like a widescreen heroine's journey in 10 parts — or maybe 11, if you count the swooning opening dream sequence of Stand And Deliver, with its spoken word invocation of Shirley Temple via Edie Sedgwick\\.\r\nThe far bookend is Stamina, another seven\\-minute drama that rises from liquid guitar ripples to an ecstatic, crashing crescendo of drums and determination\\.\r\nThe pendulum swings from ether calm to operatic epiphany within the space of any given song\\. The electronic glitch and thrash of My Love Is My Disease balances the symphonic undulations of A Message From My Mothers Passed\\. \r\nThe sinuous groove and sigh of Smile and the sensuous swing and electro burbles of Pleasure Drive find the band forging breathtaking new scaffolds of rhythm and melody for stories that have never been more timely\\. \r\n\"Previously I've shrouded myself a lot in mystery and the language of romanticism; played roles and stuff — which reflected some kind of truth about how I felt as a woman,\" Hayley says\\. \r\n\"Now I feel like I can be much more upfront about all that\\. The truth about how it feels to be a woman has become a much more prominent part of the general conversation in the last couple of years,\" she says\\. \"These are exciting times\\. I think we've made an album that celebrates that\\.\"\r\nTickets: $15","date":"November 17, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.479438e+12,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/events/292053434479146","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"b2d53b7e1c54484b8c9a64fabd0c3bd1","lat":40.76381495071518,"lng":-111.87577608414924,"active":true,"__v":0}

Be the LEAD SINGER of a Live Band with This Is Your Band (TIYB), playing here every Thursday night!  This IS the ONLY Live Band Karaoke in Utah...and once you experience it, you'll never look at Karaoke the same!  They have over 1000 songs to choose from - to view their list, go to thisisyourband.com and download their songlist!  Arrive early to get on the list...it fills up fast and we want to hear YOU sing!  Come early and enjoy one of our delicious dinner entrees and your favorite beverages all night long!  This event is SOOOOO popular that the LIST fills up fast, and we want as many of you to be able to sing every Thursday as possible, so please review the following so we can get as many of you up on stage as possible and to avoid any confusion:   1. You must sign up on the list with our KJ - Paul Woody (PDub). He is the ONLY person that can sign people up to sing. Watch for him to arrive and get your name on the list.  2. You must ALREADY have your song picked out when you ask Paul to sign you up - NO EXCEPTIONS.   3. Paul will announce 3 singers at a time: UP NEXT, ON DECK, and IN THE HOLE. When you are in the ON DECK position, you need to be at the stage BEFORE the current singer completes their song so you can go right up. We need you ready to go when it is your turn to avoid delays which takes singing time away. If you ARE NOT ready to take stage when it is your turn, you will lose your turn and will need ask to get back on the list (at the bottom). NO EXCEPTIONS!  3. DO NOT ask to be bumped up on the list - it will not happen. It is not fair to other singers who have been waiting their turn.  4. If you want to be put on the list again after you have sang, you can sign up immediately after completing your song ONLY.  5. A duet counts as one person's song. If a singer invites you up to sing a duet with them, that WILL NOT count as YOUR song, and you will keep your current place on the list.    It is BEST to arrive early to get your name on the list and get up as quickly as possible. That MAY improve your chance to sing again later in the evening, but is NOT a guarantee.","date":"November 17, 2016","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4794416e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"0c69586e43c640519906c0c3dc21b871","lat":40.58665734936572,"lng":-111.89565093944732,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 17, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.479366e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"eeb82e09fcdc4427b20bcb216b276cb0","lat":40.76849075258012,"lng":-111.89459608414455,"active":true,"__v":0}

Her work is a sparse and delicate treatment of the mundanity of routine and the day to day.

It takes me back to the place where my grandfather spent his last weeks, where my husband learned to love people in a distant land, where a close cousin and friend had a baby, and sometimes to where I find beauty in the least expected places.

Mountain biking, hiking, tennis, and playing the electric guitar round out the list of pursuits for this U.C. San Diego graduate. He has a beautiful wife and two adorable children.\r\n\r\nPaul’s work has recently been highlighted by *National Geographic*, *USA Today*, *KSL.com*, *Utah.com*, Bolsa Chica Conservancy, Sea \u0026 Sage Audubon Society, The Environmental Nature Center, *Orange County Register*, *Irvine World News*, *Focusingonwildlife.com*, and *WildlifePhotographyNews.net*.

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 17, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.479366e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"7c352bedfb8143cfb44b283d1528549f","lat":40.780584866770894,"lng":-111.89925999867803,"active":true,"__v":0}

That English wasn't her first language is actually an advantage in her songwriting: Her breathy lyrics take unexpected turns and leave you reaching at beautiful metaphors you can't quite grasp\\. Birkenes admits, \"I am a little obscure at times; maybe that's how I feel I can be honest\\.\" Her songs draw from personal experiences but leave things open\\-ended enough that you can't help but lean into them and commiserate\\.\r\nThis balance is what helped inform the magical blend that made up her 2014 debut album Pocketknife, a wandering soundscape of songs both dark and gritty \\(hard, menacing drums drive the beat of \"Good Mistake\"\\) and staggeringly elegant \\(\"Oh Sailor\" tugs at heartstrings with help from the Silver Lake children's' choir\\)\\.\r\nBirkenes and long\\-time collaborator Tim Anderson have now come back together for her second release — the F E V E R S EP \\(Out October 21 via Nettwerk Records\\)\\. Like on Pocketknife, new songs \"Stitches\" and title track \"Fevers\" are pop hymnals, sparkling oases that temper but don't hide the uncertainty of living\\. F E V E R S also makes a strong connection between Scandinavian musicality and the Los Angeles point\\-of\\-view, bringing together everything that has made Birkenes a part of Mr Little Jeans, and vise\\-versa\\.\r\nTickets: $12","date":"November 18, 2016","startTime":"18:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4795172e+12,"url":"http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=867088\u0026b=234786\u0026m=27601\u0026urllink=https%3a%2f%2fwww.ticketfly.com%2fpurchase%2fevent%2f1322115%2ftfly%3futm_medium%3dapi","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"478adba0a3444bc1bba262bc152177b6","lat":40.75313548808656,"lng":-111.90085520886,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each piece inspires the other; a song creates a visual image, a painting comes to\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nlife in video, and a video becomes a work of art.

Of course, this\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nemotional experience can be enhanced by a natural connection to the genre or style of\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nthe art. This emotion becomes even more forceful by combining fine art, music, and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nvideo in a way that influences and creates a relationship from one creative offering to the\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nother. It can additionally be enhanced by understanding the creative thought and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nexecution process that goes into this work. With that said, my hope is that this triad of\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nart, music and video will inspire people to not just understand and appreciate the\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ncreative process more, but cause them to think a little deeper about humanity and our\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nrelationship to each other, hopefully resulting in a little more respect and a little less\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nanger.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nExhibit runs from November 2 nd – November 27 th 2016\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nArtist Reception: November 4 th | 6-9pm\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nGallery Stroll: November 18 th | 6-9pm\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nGallery Hours: Tues – Sat 12-8pm and Sun 12-6pm.

McKee's tour dates have taken him through Europe, Asia, Australia and North America, including tours with legendary acts including Prince and Dream Theater\\. \r\nLive performances of Andy's have become a point of fascination with his loyal followers\\.

The all-Prokofiev program will also feature the composer’s Symphonic Suite from the film, “Lieutenant Kijé” – both the cantata and suite will be recorded live for later release. Also on the program, Utah Symphony Concertmaster **Madeline Adkins** will make her Utah Symphony concerto debut in a performance of Prokofiev’s Concerto No. 2 for Violin. Tickets start at $21 and can be purchased at www.utahsymphony.org or by calling (801) 533-6683.\r\n\r\nThe Utah Symphony’s live recording of the all-Prokofiev album will be the fourth live album released by Maestro Fischer and Utah Symphony: Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 “Titan” was released in September 2015, and a recording of world premiere commissions by three American composers entitled “Dawn to Dust,” was released in April 2016, coinciding with the Utah Symphony’s first performance at Carnegie Hall in New York City in more than 40 years. Both recordings were released as part of the Orchestra’s 75th anniversary celebrations. As part of the O.C Tanner Gift of Music concert series, Mahler’s Symphony No. 8 “Symphony of a Thousand” was recorded with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and The Madeleine Choir School on February 19 and 20, 2016 inside the Salt Lake Tabernacle and will be released on Reference Recordings in 2017.\r\n\r\nIn the early 20th century, as an emerging young composer and music intellectual, Russian musician Sergei Prokofiev penetrated the cultural barriers of the new Soviet government in his homeland to become a cosmopolitan traveler and distinctly dynamic composer. In the forefront of modern music, he turned to great masters of Classical form, including Franz Joseph Haydn, for inspiration. From the deftly crafted, funny and melancholic emotional layers of his film score for “Lieutenant Kijé,” to the stark contrast of his dramatic film score for “Alexander Nevsky,” which he later arranged into the cantata, his music never ceases to surprise audiences.\r\n\r\nShortly after completing “Lieutenant Kijé,” Prokofiev composed his Concerto No. 2 for Violin and Orchestra, which represented a much different style—more international and more starkly modern. However, the concerto is traditional in its construction and opens with an appealing melody based on Russian folk tunes. This charming theme dominates the second movement, a graceful andante. The third movement, an allegro, is evocative of Spain. The concerto won immediate acclaim at its premiere in Madrid in 1935.\r\n\r\n**Madeline Adkins** performs Prokofiev’s Violin Concerto No. 2 in her debut solo performance as Concertmaster of the Utah Symphony under Maestro Thierry Fischer. Before joining the Utah Symphony in September of this year, she held the position of Associate Concertmaster of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra by Maestro Yuri Temirkanov, a position she was awarded in 2005, after joining the orchestra as Assistant Concertmaster in 2000. She has also been Concertmaster of the Baltimore Chamber Orchestra since 2008. Ms. Adkins received her bachelor’s degree summa cum laude from the University of North Texas and her master’s degree from the New England Conservatory. While a student, she served as Concertmaster of the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra under Seiji Ozawa and won first prize in a number of competitions, including the Stulberg International String Competition, and the New England Conservatory Concerto Competition. She was also a second prize winner in the Irving Klein International String Competition.\r\n\r\nRussian mezzo-soprano **Alisa Kolosova** joins the Utah Symphony as a guest artist to capture the drama and emotion of the historical epic “Alexander Nevsky.\" Ms. Kolosova has appeared to great acclaim at many of the most prestigious opera houses throughout the world, including the Opéra National de Paris, Bayerische Staatsoper, Salzburg Festival, Wiener Staatsoper, and Glyndebourne Festival Opera, and has performed at concert venues including the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. and Carnegie Hall in New York.\r\n\r\nUtah Symphony Chorus Director **Dr. Barlow Bradford** has distinguished himself as a conductor, composer, arranger, pianist, organist, and teacher. Dr. Bradford's focused, energetic conducting style led to his appointment as Music Director of the Orchestra at Temple Square in Salt Lake City and Associate Director of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Prior to that, he was Director of Orchestras at the University of Utah. His compositions and arrangements have garnered much attention for their innovation and dramatic scope, from delicate, transparent intimacy to epic grandeur. Arrangements by Bradford have been performed and recorded by the Cleveland Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Dallas Symphony, Tucson Symphony Orchestra, New York Choral Artists, Seattle Pacific University, Baylor University, Mormon Tabernacle Choir/Orchestra at Temple Square, Newfoundland Festival 500, and the San Francisco Gay Men’s Chorus, among others.

The all-Prokofiev program will also feature the composer’s Symphonic Suite from the film, “Lieutenant Kijé” – both the cantata and suite will be recorded live for later release. Also on the program, Utah Symphony Concertmaster **Madeline Adkins** will make her Utah Symphony concerto debut in a performance of Prokofiev’s Concerto No. 2 for Violin. Tickets start at $21 and can be purchased at www.utahsymphony.org or by calling (801) 533-6683.\r\n\r\nThe Utah Symphony’s live recording of the all-Prokofiev album will be the fourth live album released by Maestro Fischer and Utah Symphony: Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 “Titan” was released in September 2015, and a recording of world premiere commissions by three American composers entitled “Dawn to Dust,” was released in April 2016, coinciding with the Utah Symphony’s first performance at Carnegie Hall in New York City in more than 40 years. Both recordings were released as part of the Orchestra’s 75th anniversary celebrations. As part of the O.C Tanner Gift of Music concert series, Mahler’s Symphony No. 8 “Symphony of a Thousand” was recorded with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and The Madeleine Choir School on February 19 and 20, 2016 inside the Salt Lake Tabernacle and will be released on Reference Recordings in 2017.\r\n\r\nIn the early 20th century, as an emerging young composer and music intellectual, Russian musician Sergei Prokofiev penetrated the cultural barriers of the new Soviet government in his homeland to become a cosmopolitan traveler and distinctly dynamic composer. In the forefront of modern music, he turned to great masters of Classical form, including Franz Joseph Haydn, for inspiration. From the deftly crafted, funny and melancholic emotional layers of his film score for “Lieutenant Kijé,” to the stark contrast of his dramatic film score for “Alexander Nevsky,” which he later arranged into the cantata, his music never ceases to surprise audiences.\r\n\r\nShortly after completing “Lieutenant Kijé,” Prokofiev composed his Concerto No. 2 for Violin and Orchestra, which represented a much different style—more international and more starkly modern. However, the concerto is traditional in its construction and opens with an appealing melody based on Russian folk tunes. This charming theme dominates the second movement, a graceful andante. The third movement, an allegro, is evocative of Spain. The concerto won immediate acclaim at its premiere in Madrid in 1935.\r\n\r\n**Madeline Adkins** performs Prokofiev’s Violin Concerto No. 2 in her debut solo performance as Concertmaster of the Utah Symphony under Maestro Thierry Fischer. Before joining the Utah Symphony in September of this year, she held the position of Associate Concertmaster of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra by Maestro Yuri Temirkanov, a position she was awarded in 2005, after joining the orchestra as Assistant Concertmaster in 2000. She has also been Concertmaster of the Baltimore Chamber Orchestra since 2008. Ms. Adkins received her bachelor’s degree summa cum laude from the University of North Texas and her master’s degree from the New England Conservatory. While a student, she served as Concertmaster of the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra under Seiji Ozawa and won first prize in a number of competitions, including the Stulberg International String Competition, and the New England Conservatory Concerto Competition. She was also a second prize winner in the Irving Klein International String Competition.\r\n\r\nRussian mezzo-soprano **Alisa Kolosova** joins the Utah Symphony as a guest artist to capture the drama and emotion of the historical epic “Alexander Nevsky.\" Ms. Kolosova has appeared to great acclaim at many of the most prestigious opera houses throughout the world, including the Opéra National de Paris, Bayerische Staatsoper, Salzburg Festival, Wiener Staatsoper, and Glyndebourne Festival Opera, and has performed at concert venues including the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. and Carnegie Hall in New York.\r\n\r\nUtah Symphony Chorus Director **Dr. Barlow Bradford** has distinguished himself as a conductor, composer, arranger, pianist, organist, and teacher. Dr. Bradford's focused, energetic conducting style led to his appointment as Music Director of the Orchestra at Temple Square in Salt Lake City and Associate Director of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Prior to that, he was Director of Orchestras at the University of Utah. His compositions and arrangements have garnered much attention for their innovation and dramatic scope, from delicate, transparent intimacy to epic grandeur. Arrangements by Bradford have been performed and recorded by the Cleveland Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Dallas Symphony, Tucson Symphony Orchestra, New York Choral Artists, Seattle Pacific University, Baylor University, Mormon Tabernacle Choir/Orchestra at Temple Square, Newfoundland Festival 500, and the San Francisco Gay Men’s Chorus, among others. He also continues as Music Director of Utah Chamber Artists.","date":"November 19, 2016","startTime":"19:30","endTime":"","timeValue":1.479609e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"a462764a23004053b7b7e7460b0cf470","lat":40.76862929828619,"lng":-111.89513989994893,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 25, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4800572e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"a2a9521431b9453e99cfc3ab3206a60d","lat":40.76844197616934,"lng":-111.89463049701595,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 25, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4800572e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"18b7d367f9da440d98358c85c09a8fa5","lat":40.78047057723255,"lng":-111.89911075445991,"active":true,"__v":0}

Combining the creative emotions of vision, sound and movement, Toro’s newest\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nexhibit takes the viewer/participant through all the creative senses to view humanity in\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nmany forms, as it evolves into what we are all meant to be, creatures of love.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nMusic, Art, \u0026amp; Video is the theme that wraps through the 60 works of art, 6 musical\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\npieces and 6 video works that Toro has created and invites you to participate in with\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nhim. Each piece inspires the other; a song creates a visual image, a painting comes to\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nlife in video, and a video becomes a work of art. As you walk through the exhibit you are\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ninvited to see and touch the paintings, as well as view each video on a monitor while\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nlistening with earphones to the music. A complete immersion in the creative process and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nthe mind of Jimmi Toro.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nToro says “I believe every piece of art, each video viewed, and every song listened to\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ncan give off a portion of its original emotion to the listener and observer. Of course, this\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nemotional experience can be enhanced by a natural connection to the genre or style of\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nthe art. This emotion becomes even more forceful by combining fine art, music, and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nvideo in a way that influences and creates a relationship from one creative offering to the\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nother. It can additionally be enhanced by understanding the creative thought and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nexecution process that goes into this work. With that said, my hope is that this triad of\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nart, music and video will inspire people to not just understand and appreciate the\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ncreative process more, but cause them to think a little deeper about humanity and our\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nrelationship to each other, hopefully resulting in a little more respect and a little less\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nanger.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nExhibit runs from November 2 nd – November 27 th 2016\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nArtist Reception: November 4 th | 6-9pm\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nGallery Stroll: November 18 th | 6-9pm\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nGallery Hours: Tues – Sat 12-8pm and Sun 12-6pm.

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 26, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4801436e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"17c8bb6dd23145df9ac330bca888f43b","lat":40.768353292652755,"lng":-111.89468530477762,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 26, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4801436e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"d1503f1288b445178c00201327ed481b","lat":40.780559767579554,"lng":-111.89910473653892,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each piece inspires the other; a song creates a visual image, a painting comes to\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nlife in video, and a video becomes a work of art. As you walk through the exhibit you are\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ninvited to see and touch the paintings, as well as view each video on a monitor while\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nlistening with earphones to the music.

Of course, this\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nemotional experience can be enhanced by a natural connection to the genre or style of\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nthe art. This emotion becomes even more forceful by combining fine art, music, and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nvideo in a way that influences and creates a relationship from one creative offering to the\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nother. It can additionally be enhanced by understanding the creative thought and\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nexecution process that goes into this work. With that said, my hope is that this triad of\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nart, music and video will inspire people to not just understand and appreciate the\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\ncreative process more, but cause them to think a little deeper about humanity and our\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nrelationship to each other, hopefully resulting in a little more respect and a little less\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nanger.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nExhibit runs from November 2 nd – November 27 th 2016\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nArtist Reception: November 4 th | 6-9pm\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nGallery Stroll: November 18 th | 6-9pm\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nGallery Hours: Tues – Sat 12-8pm and Sun 12-6pm.

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 28, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4803164e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"11c5eb75f0f24c7a8c4bec17ed48fa43","lat":40.78057887137257,"lng":-111.89928077031526,"active":true,"__v":0}

Evidential mediumship is a style of mediumship practiced around the world that puts heavy weight on the medium’s ability to bring through extremely specific evidence to the sitter. This evidence can include, but is certainly not limited to, names, personality traits, physical ailments, favorite past times, and phrases often used by loved ones in spirit. The purpose of this style of mediumship is to diminish skepticism among sitters and to prove that the medium is truly connecting with the client’s loved ones in spirit.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nCindy has been extremely intuitive since very early childhood. At the age of 10 she had her first memorable experience with a spirit. Days after losing a childhood friend in a fatal car accident, Cindy woke up in the middle of the night to see her friend standing next to her bed. At the time, she dismissed this experience and convinced herself it was just a dream. It wasn’t until her early 20’s that she realized she was having psychic and mediumistic experiences all along. During this “awakening” she began searching for answers and reasons for her experiences and became aware of her multi-faceted abilities as a psychic medium. She began training not only in the United States but also at the Arthur Findlay School of Intuitive Sciences in Stansted, England. She believes in compassionately sharing her gift with others while also opening up others to the gifts they too possess and that everyone is inherently intuitive and able to feel Spirit!","date":"November 29, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4804712e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"9a561b77a0e54742ad546b0553fe88b1","lat":40.764921486780025,"lng":-111.90273363268679,"active":true,"__v":0}

A mirror, Yata-no-Kagami, is one of the three objects that constitute the Imperial Regalia of Japan. These objects originate in one of the most ancient myths of Japan written in both of the oldest Japanese texts, the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki. In the myth, Amaterasu-ōmikami–the goddess of the sun–hides in a cave after her brother destroys her loom and kills one of her attendants. She eventually is coaxed out of the cave by the other sympathetic gods who need her sunlight. They place the Yata-no-Kagami in front of the entrance to the cave. After peeking out and seeing her glorious reflection, Amaterasu is lured out of the cave, once again filling the world with light.\r\nIn the future, what will Google Earth become? Possibly, a digital world that so precisely reflects our physical world allowing us to see ourselves digitally as well as we can see physically.\r\n\r\nA.I. is said to be imminent, with some fearing it will be an unknowable, unstoppable force. But the internet may already be the A.I. we are anticipating. It is indeed an artificially created form of consciousness comprised of all of us at once, yet none of us individually at one time. Twitter and Facebook trends are developing the vague conceptions of an infantile hive mind that will eventually cover the planet, rendering Earth an entity with a form of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThinking of the internet as a fledgling A.I., the issue of net neutrality becomes more than just an issue of socialist utility vs. capitalist service. Companies that have had key roles in the development of the internet would also then become involved in this battle for ownership, possibly affecting the future of consciousness.\r\n\r\n*Digital Mirror: Selfie Consciousness* depicts this battle that will decide the fate of consciousness, by borrowing the visual language of the feudalistic Japanese samurai. The textual aspect of this language is still used in Japanese business and is often militaristic, similar to the feudalistic texts of the Sengoku period. The early internet companies could then be viewed similarly to the feudalistic organizations of the various local daimyo before the empire united under Oda Nobunaga.\r\n\r\nThe nature of consciousness is changing as swiftly as we can conceive it, affecting how we will think in the future. What will we discover about ourselves in the digital mirror we have so carefully constructed, what glory will we lure out of the cave?","date":"November 29, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4804028e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"c12e6f2c30ad4306b0e6986c528558cb","lat":40.768465019203326,"lng":-111.89467168200487,"active":true,"__v":0}

Each of us is a sum total of all our experiences, both good and bad: amazing moments, sadness and heartbreak, insecurities, first kisses, the triumphs. These events become our individual life stories — singular, beautiful, sometimes gut-wrenching — but always uniquely \"us.\" We may not be able to see those delicate intangibles of our personal stories, but they are nevertheless real.\r\n\r\nIt is the concept of the \"story\" that draws Todd to creating art from books. Not only is there a narrative to the book itself, but there is also a separate story of the person who may have owned it. He also uses reclaimed and vintage fabrics, photos, notes and other nostalgic items because he is inspired by the idea that they are real pieces of real lives, and these precious elements can be rediscovered and repurposed to create a new work of art.\r\n\r\nWorking in mixed media allows Todd to savor the \"mess,\" and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. \"I love the smell of the old paper and books. I love scouring forgotten basements in old book stores — finding unexpected treasures, then giving them new life. The unique resins I use to finish each work 'freeze' the elements I have brought together and suspend them in time forever, thereby making one beautiful piece out of many individual stories\"—not unlike how we create our own lives.","date":"November 29, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4804028e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5995/","host":"","contactNumber":"","contactEmail":"","cwId":"0d7271811fc844f8ad7f3ea9cf362919","lat":40.78046560618675,"lng":-111.89909018217939,"active":true,"__v":0}

He is a native of California but moved to Salt Lake City in July 2013. Mr. Marto grew up in Carmel Valley, CA, so it is no surprise that he gravitated towards wildlife photography. Mountain biking, hiking, tennis, and playing the electric guitar round out the list of pursuits for this U.C. San Diego graduate. He has a beautiful wife and two adorable children.\r\n\r\nPaul’s work has recently been highlighted by *National Geographic*, *USA Today*, *KSL.com*, *Utah.com*, Bolsa Chica Conservancy, Sea \u0026 Sage Audubon Society, The Environmental Nature Center, *Orange County Register*, *Irvine World News*, *Focusingonwildlife.com*, and *WildlifePhotographyNews.net*.
