It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 10, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4761368e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"ea6c88902ca34a60a5e6f8b87c3bf8d7","lat":"40.75667630416217","lng":"-111.91643230112244","__v":0}

I didn’t plan to make it and initially wasn’t sure if it was going to be an Okkervil River album or if I’d ever put it out. I wrote the songs during a confusing time of transition in my personal and professional life and recorded them quickly with a brand new group of musicians. I got together the best New York players I could think of, people whose playing and personalities I was fans of and who came more out of a jazz or avant garde background, and we cut the songs live in one or two takes – trying to keep things as natural and immediate as possible – over three days in a studio on Long Island that hosts the Neve 8068 console which recorded Steely Dan’s Aja and John Lennon’s Double Fantasy. I asked Marissa Nadler to sing on it and got the composer Nathan Thatcher to write some beautiful orchestral arrangements, we recorded them with the classical ensemble yMusic and then I mixed the record with Jonathan Wilson out in Los Angeles. - Will Sheff\r\n\r\nLandlady\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\n\"This is the part of the song when we come together,\" Adam Schatz's voice rings out. \"There's no before. There's no after. There's only this.\" Schatz leads Landlady, the Brooklyn five-piece whose 2014 Hometapes debut, Upright Behavior, boldly disrupts the notion of genre and reveals the soulful and continually-resonating work of Schatz and core band members Ian Chang, Ian McLellan Davis, Booker Stardrum, and Will Graefe, as well as a cast of NYC-based contributors gathered from Schatz's tandem walks of life as a solo musician, improviser, organizer, collaborator, promoter, and writer. Compared to rock and roll juggernauts like The Band and Talking Heads, Landlady merge vast skill, a bend toward experimentation, and a proven belief that songs can be a true extension of the human experience. The result is timeless and charted by their recorded works and transformative live shows — both critically-acclaimed and ever-evolving. The next era was revealed this summer: Heat, a new EP, was released for free to fans worldwide and will be exclusively available on cassette tape on their US tour with passionate peers Son Lux and Buke and Gase.","date":"October 10, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4761476e+12,"url":"http://www.theurbanloungeslc.com/event/1192431-okkervil-river-salt-lake-city/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"7159560b30934d5c8378411541fe9298","lat":"40.763796828203304","lng":"-111.8758257162648","__v":0}

It was the fall of 2008 over a bottle of cheap booze when co-founders Barry Johnson (guitar, vocals) and Chase Knobbe (guitar) decided to team up. They formed a power violence band where everyone would have Johnny Thunders-style glam-names … like \"Joyce Manor\" named after an apartment complex Barry walked past every day. But when longtime friend Andrew Jackson Jihad suddenly asked Barry if his old band wanted to open for their LA show, he scrambled to say yes.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n\"I was like, 'We have a new band!' 'What's it called?' And the first thing I thought of was … 'Uh, Joyce Manor!' We didn't even have a band. But they put it on the flyer.\"\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nSo Joyce Manor made their debut as an acoustic two-piece, with Chase and Barry quickly learned that they were really a pop-punk band trapped inside a folk-punk duo—too many songs just demanded bass and drums. \"Playing loud is just more fun,\" explains Barry.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBy the end of 2009, they'd made a new friend in new drummer Kurt Walcher and welcomed old friend Matt Ebert back from Portland to play bass. (\"He moved back like, 'Dude, wanna start a band?'\" says Barry. \"And I said, 'Wanna be in THIS band?'\") With their line-up settled, they attacked their songs with new enthusiasm and neurotic precision, discovering their own kind of beauty in simplicity and pursuing heartbroken punk perfection.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nTheir first self-titled album in 2011 exploded out of nowhere and their second in 2012 landed them on the storied Asian Man Records, home of all of Barry's first favorite bands. Across these two albums, they discovered what Joyce Manor really sounded like—the speed and sense of melody of fellow South Bay band the Descendents, the artfully bittersweet lyricism of Jawbreaker and the undeniable heart-on-sleeve honesty of the first two Weezer albums. By the close of 2013, they had the experience, the discipline and the inspiration to make one of those rare albums that redefines a young band—Never Hungover Again, on Epitaph Records.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nSome of these songs, they'd been working on for years, says Barry. Joyce Manor never demos. They just mercilessly rehearse, chopping and editing and reworking songs until there's nothing left that lags. (\"I just know when it's right,\" says Barry) Guitarist Chase had graduated to a co-writing position with Barry, pouring new ideas and techniques into the songs, and while their first two albums were learn-as-you-go experiences, they started Never Hungover Again with a vision, a budget and two whole weeks to make exactly what they wanted. (That's a long time in Joyce Manor world.) Friend and Philly producer Joe Reinhardt took the controls in Hollywood's analog dreamland the Lair. They assigned the final mix to Tony Hoffer—the guy who found the definitive sound Supergrass, Belle and Sebastian, M83 and Phoenix.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nTogether, they made an album of pop-punk in paradox, right down to the title and photo on the cover. It's something like believing the impossible, says Barry, or at least the too good to be true: \"Those people look wasted—yeah, there will definitely be a hangover! There will be pain!'\" (Referring to the cover art). It is ten precisely put-together songs about how things fall apart, with some of the saddest lyrics you'd ever shout along to from the front row.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nThere are broken homes, drunken nights, faltering relationships and the kind of numbness that makes you want to feel anything at all, even if it hurts. Naturally, there are some Morrissey-esque moments in there—like \"In the Army Now\" about watching friends grow out of music and move on. Or in \"End of the Summer,\" which somehow puts a Big Star-style intro in front of Moz-ian vocals and a chorus that's pure blue-album Weezer. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n\"Heart Tattoo\" is a pop-punk stormer (think Lifetime or Dillinger Four) about what really happens when you get a tattoo—\"What about the regret?\" asks Barry. And \"Catalina Fight Song\" is maybe Hungover's definitive song, about hanging out on the cliffs that overlook the Pacific—what locals call the end of the world—and thinking \"What the fuck am I gonna do?\"\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIf there's a feeling to Never Hungover Again, says Barry, it's a feeling he can't quite pin down—some complex thing that's part anger and part sadness. It's the loneliness when you're surrounded by people and that lostness when everything you've wanted seems to be right in front of you. And if there's a single moment that defines Never Hungover Again, it's the way \"The Jerk\" ends with feedback and a chord ringing over Barry's last shout of \"It all goes wrong!\"—because despite the confusion and sorrow and resignation, it somehow sounds so right.\r\n\r\nThe Hotelier\r\n\r\nWatch\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to say that The Hotelier have grown older, or wiser, or more of anything. We can trace a progression, if we like, from the explosive empowerment of It Never Goes Out to the ashen disillusionment of Home, Like Noplace Is There. We can follow an awakening of youth in suburbia attempting to learn what is right, and what is ours, and what is possible and impossible, and maybe we can't save each other like we thought we once could. We're awake and we're tired and we want love in our lives again. And so we find ourselves now in Goodness, in the woods outside of the suburbs, trying to re-learn that love.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBut we seek a space outside time. Once in a while we can feel it, like a clearing. Where our histories and our rhetoric blends into languages spoken and unspoken. Where the greatest awe comes upon us for the overlooked, the simple, the incomprehensible. Where things glitch as they solidify, repeat as they evolve, scream as they whisper. Where always and forever above us, in all of its natural, unnatural, supernatural love, shines the moon. Goodness is not this place -- goodness is nowhere -- but we are following it to where we have to be.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nAfter all we've gone through, how young are we? What is age softening in us, what is it hardening in us? Are we getting better? Worse? How could we ever know, when capital forces us onward away from ourselves? Will the woods consume the suburbs; will the suburbs consume the woods? In the gaps between these monumental questions, in the tiniest details, in the infinitude of cycles outside of time, there is Goodness. We begin there.\r\n\r\nCrying\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nThe Crying formula is simple: drench an entry-level Motown song in creamy distortion, completely flip the vocal dynamics without losing any of the juicy flavor, and squirt in a few too many twisted melodies played out of a programmed Game Boy. Mixing regal riffs and tasty beats with soft vocals, intimate lyrics (oftentimes crushingly so), and harsh but sparkling synth lines, the New York power trio strikes a stylistic balance between decades and genres, each song bearing the gifts of timelessness and formal disrespect. \"Get Olde Second Wind,\" Crying's first Run For Cover release, works as both an anthology and a cohesive work, compiling the critically acclaimed self-released EP, \"Get Olde,\" and its brand new, darker and danker sequel, \"Second Wind.\"\r\n\r\nVenue Information:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nKilby Court\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n741 Kilby Court\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nSalt Lake City, UT, 84101\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nhttp://kilbycourt.com/kilbycourt/calendar/listing.html","date":"October 11, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.476234e+12,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/events/828486393949674","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"da11d4f77e4040d1ae684d714d6dc360","lat":"40.75313240497974","lng":"-111.90075778114124","__v":0}

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy.

The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind.

Yet amid this push, battles are being fought over our online privacy and who controls our online identities that pit global policymakers against some of the world’s largest companies like Google and Amazon. In this fight, Europe has become a major player. It already has some of the toughest privacy standards worldwide, going further than the United States to offer people control over their online data. And a raft of recent legal decisions have extended Europe’s reach beyond its borders, potentially giving it control over how people in the United States and beyond interact online. Have these efforts gone too far? And should Europe be allowed to dictate how global privacy and data protection standards are created?\r\n\r\n___\r\n \r\n\r\nThis lecture is sponsored by World Affairs Council of America in partnership with Mariusz M.

Calhoun: High Places Make Me High","primCategory":"visual arts","primSubCategory":"galleries","secCategory":"","secSubCategory":"","locationName":"Sweet Branch","address":"455 F Street","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"My early desire to become a museum-quality artist guides me with an unwavering faith. With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside.

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world? He lives in Salt Lake City.","date":"October 11, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4761656e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"8c15dba8ae2d4f1ba55e012de69998ef","lat":"40.780509805422916","lng":"-111.89921464659601","__v":0}

The Associated Press hailed it “an epochal album, a generational capstone that will reside in playlists for a generation to come,” and SPIN named it one of the “50 Best Albums Of 2014”.  The album made an impressive #1 debut on iTunes’ Alternative Chart and #5 on iTunes’ Top Album Chart.  VOICES also yielded the multi-format anthem “Fall In Love,” which landed in the Top 5 at Alternative Radio and Top 25 at AAA. It was also the #4 “Most-Shazamed Rock and Indie Song of 2014”.\r\n\r\nThe band has since been on the road and collaborating with an impressive group of artists across the music spectrum, including The Flaming Lips, Miley Cyrus and Big Boi – the latter of whom formed a new group with Phantogram, BIG GRAMS, resulting in the release of a self-titled debut album (featuring its own collaborations with Skrillex and Run the Jewels, and a psychedelic animated short film project with Adult Swim) in 2015.\r\n\r\nThis year, Barthel and Carter have performed a handful of summer festival dates with Big Grams, including Governor’s Ball and Bonnaroo, with the likes of Lollapalooza and Outside Lands on the horizon, before releasing their highly anticipated new Phantogram album.","date":"October 11, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.476234e+12,"url":"http://www.facebook.com/events/235702750150498","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"c3af2a9429684e36b933c7237e2f6050","lat":"40.76454889801687","lng":"-111.90808133838539","__v":0}

There are only six students allowed per class, and this small-group format makes for a fun, innovative, and semi-private art instruction experience. These classes help children develop artistic skills while nurturing imagination, and are a great way to enhance their creative ability and self-confidence. The goal is to cultivate the children’s visual awareness and expand aesthetic senses.\r\n\r\nThrough the process of creating a harmonious image, Fahimeh’s students learn the principles of rhythm, balance, variety, and motion.

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 12, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4763096e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"7023800555fe4450acd2e14283d7202f","lat":"40.75654799701277","lng":"-111.91636015913204","__v":0}

Among them:\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nFrontman Zoë Reign is the only living member of the long extinct human subspecies, homo erectus. His cave-tatted and zaftig body was found perfectly preserved within a gigantic slab of dank resin, excavated from a North Hollywood backyard by a pair of teenaged twins, whom, in the throes of a Blue Dream-edible-induced bad trip, had become convinced that the ghost of G.G. Allin would haunt their local sesh spot were they not to unearth a mysterious object from behind their uncle's ranch house.\r\n___\r\nBassist Killian LeDuke is both blessed and cursed by his possession of a rare Poon-Slayer's Statuette, which in appearance is not far off from the Venus of {look up}, but unlike that ancient artifact, is said to faintly emit the chorus of the Stooges' \"T.V. Eye\", a tune which grows louder if the object comes within the presence of a particularly bodacious babe. Accounts conflict on the actual psychophysical effects of the totem– make your own call if you ever come within 5-10 feet of Mr. LeDuke.\r\n___\r\nGuitarist Ryan McGuffin learned how to play his scintillating riffs from a group of hyperintelligent Fender-wielding crustaceans. One day while surfing Leo Carrillo during a super gnarly swell, he was pulled under (after getting way too pitted in a tube of opaque Pacific trash-water.) Rendered unconscious by a critical case of board-to-dome, he would have certainly perished beneath the waves had he not been furnished with scuba gear by the aforementioned rock lobsters. Somewhere along the line, the rumor goes, they taught him how to shred, but the details here are fuzzy, as it remains unclear how these clawed creatures could pluck a guitar string without snapping it, not to mention how an amp could function underwater.\r\n___\r\nMonty, the drummer, is an alien.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n–––\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nInteresting as these rumors may be, their veracity is far beside the point.

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world? He lives in Salt Lake City.","date":"October 12, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.476252e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"985aa5bdf9b34242a88c1fc76c5a96f7","lat":"40.780477155668336","lng":"-111.89910374472258","__v":0}

As a result, that music has sent shockwaves throughout the entire genre. Over the course of six full length albums and a myriad of single releases, he's yielded worldwide hits as diverse as \"Ripple\", which claimed #1 on Beatport's Download Chart, and \"Bombaclaad Star\", which reigned supreme as the hub's #1 reggae track of 2011. \"Shake My Ass\" dominated the drum 'n' bass chart at #1, while his third album Private Riot has become a dubstep classic in its own right, solidifying him as a trailblazer.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nHowever, he's bringing two worlds together into one on his forthcoming seventh album, The Renegade Crusade. Dubstep sorcery and Rastafarian grooves collide and cascade within a genre the dance floor has never seen before. The age of The Renegade begins now.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAbout this alchemical concoction on his forthcoming 2013 effort, he reveals, \"It's my attempt to put everything I've done in my musical career into some type of synthesis. It can be hard and intense, but it can also be beautiful and trippy. This symbiosis is natural. As humans we all have different emotions. The music reflects those emotions. I'm looking to combine all of those catalytic experiences.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn a sense, the artist has been on this path since he was merely four years old. Recalling his earliest musical memory growing up in Sweden, he'd crawl to the family piano and play for his parents. A few years later, his dad bought him his first synthesizer, and an entirely new world opened up. After years of successful studio work post high school, Liquid Stranger was formally born in 2003. His genre fusion began to enchant the entire scene.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nHe didn't simply transplant himself from Europe to Scottsdale, AZ for music though. There are many facets to the enigma he's built. In between touring and making music, he became a yoga instructor, spending four years in an Ashram. He also continued to evolve in martial arts, a passion he's held since the age of six. His studies extended to Native American medicine, immersing himself in Sun Dance ceremonies and excursions.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"I've always been a seeker,\" admits Liquid Stranger. \"If I do something, I'm going to try to master it. I've always been interested in pursuits that mirror a bottomless well. They're so mething you can never really grasp. As a musician, I always try to have as little control over the creative as possible. The less my ego and control issues get in the way, the better the music is that I make. On good days, I'm more of a channel than the brain behind it. Inspiration is such an untamed, crazy, and wild beast.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThat's also the best way to describe his live show. He's won over audiences at Electric Daisy Carnival, Voov Experience, Boom Festival, Roskilde and more. He's also set to mount a full scale headline tour with the release of The Renegade Crusade.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nIn many ways, the entire ethos can be traced back to his very moniker. He goes on, \"The reality is twofold. Liquid represents something fluid and formless that can be adapted to any given container. In other words, I can go seamlessly between any genre, tempo, emotion, or whatever I want. You never know what I'm going to do next.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThe questions will only continue to percolate around Liquid Stranger, but so will the unforgettable and undeniable music.\r\n\r\nBleep Bloop\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nBleep Bloop's musical world is one of stripped back, bass-heavy beats paired with stark,surreal soundscapes. Aggressive and off the wall sounds weave in and out of heavy drums as he blends genre's into a low frequency style that works as well at a festival as it does in your headphones.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nBleep Bloop has earned the support of distinguished artists such as DJ Shadow, Noisia, 12th Planet,DJ Craze, Kode9, Boyz Noize, Minnesota, Herobust, and G Jones, to name just a few. He has performed at sold out shows in flagship venues across the country alongside DJ Shadow,Cashmere Cat as well as Low End Theory (LA). His music has been broadcast on BBC Radio1, MistaJam, Diplo and Friends, Rinse FM, and on every continent except for antarctica (maybe).\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"Angular, brutal and barbed with a bass tongue that tickles with both a west coast and UK twang, it's the sound Bleep Bloop has been cooking since he was first baptized by bass\" -Dave Jenkins, UKF\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nBass dipped in liquid question marks and rolled in lazers.\r\n\r\nshlump\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nShlump also know as; Michael Petzel, has been making music for many years. With a background knowledge of classical guitar, drums, piano, and many years of playing live music in bands. Shlump has a unique perspective of music, and brings a wide range of interesting styles and sounds to the dance floor.\r\n\r\nPercolator\r\n\r\nPercolator was born in a shack in the late 1500's. After imposing the Helsinki Safe Handling Code of 1720, Percolator was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, but was later confined to an iron lung and was visciously accused of being sort of late sometimes. Despite confirmed reports of sightings outside the Percolator Estate in Hamburg, Percolator in fact died in a hilarious whaling accident in May of 1391.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nInfluences:\r\n___\r\nTalking Heads, Pavement, Sonic Youth, Pixies, Deerhoof, Of Montreal, Brainiac, Enon, The Breeders, Os Mutantes, Jon Brion, Max Roach, They Might Be Giants, David Bazan, Animal Collective, The Fiery Furnaces, Fugazi, Bill Callahan, The Kinks, Harry Nilsson, Menomena and Ween.","date":"October 12, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.476324e+12,"url":"http://www.theurbanloungeslc.com/event/1292379-liquid-stranger-salt-lake-city/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"526aeacc2bd34e119f527718407eefd4","lat":"40.76374139706613","lng":"-111.87574649608743","__v":0}

The classes use a classical method to teach the fundamentals of drawing, painting, color, design, and more. There are only six students allowed per class, and this small-group format makes for a fun, innovative, and semi-private art instruction experience. These classes help children develop artistic skills while nurturing imagination, and are a great way to enhance their creative ability and self-confidence. The goal is to cultivate the children’s visual awareness and expand aesthetic senses.\r\n\r\nThrough the process of creating a harmonious image, Fahimeh’s students learn the principles of rhythm, balance, variety, and motion. The realistic approach of this work requires the students to pay attention to light and shadow, color and value, and texture and proportion, as well as develop a strong aesthetic sense for composition. Every piece is designed to capture the very character of its subject.\r\n\r\nThis annual exhibition has gained popularity due to the quality of the artwork displayed by participating children.

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 13, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.476396e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"c26be07a66d14a1a995c49aadff3f541","lat":"40.7565740616387","lng":"-111.9163775987081","__v":0}

With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together.

Come early and enjoy one of our delicious dinner entrees and your favorite beverages all night long!  This event is SOOOOO popular that the LIST fills up fast, and we want as many of you to be able to sing every Thursday as possible, so please review the following so we can get as many of you up on stage as possible and to avoid any confusion:   1. You must sign up on the list with our KJ - Paul Woody (PDub). He is the ONLY person that can sign people up to sing. Watch for him to arrive and get your name on the list.  2. You must ALREADY have your song picked out when you ask Paul to sign you up - NO EXCEPTIONS.   3. Paul will announce 3 singers at a time: UP NEXT, ON DECK, and IN THE HOLE. When you are in the ON DECK position, you need to be at the stage BEFORE the current singer completes their song so you can go right up. We need you ready to go when it is your turn to avoid delays which takes singing time away. If you ARE NOT ready to take stage when it is your turn, you will lose your turn and will need ask to get back on the list (at the bottom). NO EXCEPTIONS!  3. DO NOT ask to be bumped up on the list - it will not happen. It is not fair to other singers who have been waiting their turn.  4. If you want to be put on the list again after you have sang, you can sign up immediately after completing your song ONLY.  5. A duet counts as one person's song. If a singer invites you up to sing a duet with them, that WILL NOT count as YOUR song, and you will keep your current place on the list.    It is BEST to arrive early to get your name on the list and get up as quickly as possible. That MAY improve your chance to sing again later in the evening, but is NOT a guarantee.","date":"October 13, 2016","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.476414e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"a8b0372d162d4236a76cc3260c1deb54","lat":"40.586781189406906","lng":"-111.89550111922857","__v":0}

In 1994, at age 20, Brian self-produced his debut album, Long Night Out. After that release, he then went on to compose jingles for clients such as United Airlines, Gatorade, Sears, Coors and McDonald's in the bustling city's highly competitive advertising community while still continuing to make records and tour.","date":"October 13, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4764104e+12,"url":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1198567","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"b69c8d61d5af482ea4ae5600c5912774","lat":"40.75528364826925","lng":"-111.88893415755986","__v":0}

Ghost notions that swirl around your room while you sleep. Your own pillow laughing right in your face while you fight for an hour of rest.

But in one year I went from doing that to opening for Miles Davis. It was a pretty intense jump,” he recalls. “Most shocking for me was to realize how many different people from so many diverse cultures embraced it. I still get letters from fans in Europe, South-America, Australia, and Asia...it’s been a really gratifying experience. I’ve had the opportunity to play in a wide variety of cultural settings with musicians from around the world, and that has been a great experience, too.”\r\n\r\nLiebert has since become one of the most successful instrumental artists of the past decade, thrilling audiences throughout the world and releasing a catalog of classic recordings.","date":"October 13, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4764104e+12,"url":"https://holdmyticket.com/tickets/243875","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"5f166bd5ad1047f2af958f07e1b64f3d","lat":"40.64247653925434","lng":"-111.49490068809679","__v":0}

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world?

There are only six students allowed per class, and this small-group format makes for a fun, innovative, and semi-private art instruction experience.

Calhoun: High Places Make Me High","primCategory":"visual arts","primSubCategory":"galleries","secCategory":"","secSubCategory":"","locationName":"Sweet Branch","address":"455 F Street","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"My early desire to become a museum-quality artist guides me with an unwavering faith. With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together. Thanks so much for coming.","date":"October 13, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4763384e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5680/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"41e98e7507a940689c09d46cb01cfaa3","lat":"40.779925567870976","lng":"-111.87642413009925","__v":0}

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 14, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4764824e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"11227521c0994fc983669991ef8b3747","lat":"40.75655541216879","lng":"-111.91644241624202","__v":0}

Born in Cologne, Germany to Chinese-German father and Hungarian mother, he began playing guitar at 11, and traveled extensively through Europe and Asia intent on fully absorbing each musical tradition he encountered. After pursuing his Rock and Roll dreams in Germany and then in Boston, he eventually settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he founded his band Luna Negra. \r\n\r\nTheir album, Nouveau Flamenco, began life as a self-produced local release called Marita: Shadows and Storms, copies of which local Indian artist Frank Howell distributed in his art galleries. When the record found its way to radio stations and began generating a buzz among programmers and an unprecedented response among listeners, Higher Octave Music picked it up and released a fully remastered version.\r\n\r\n“I was honestly happy playing this music in hotels and restaurants in Santa Fe. But in one year I went from doing that to opening for Miles Davis. It was a pretty intense jump,” he recalls. “Most shocking for me was to realize how many different people from so many diverse cultures embraced it. I still get letters from fans in Europe, South-America, Australia, and Asia...it’s been a really gratifying experience. I’ve had the opportunity to play in a wide variety of cultural settings with musicians from around the world, and that has been a great experience, too.”\r\n\r\nLiebert has since become one of the most successful instrumental artists of the past decade, thrilling audiences throughout the world and releasing a catalog of classic recordings.","date":"October 14, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4764968e+12,"url":"http://www.egyptiantheatrecompany.org/index.php?option=com_holdmyticket\u0026view=event\u0026id=243875","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"c9f944c5fd704520bc60d94c5316c18e","lat":"40.642572588383125","lng":"-111.49493319023891","__v":0}

Born in Cologne, Germany to Chinese-German father and Hungarian mother, he began playing guitar at 11, and traveled extensively through Europe and Asia intent on fully absorbing each musical tradition he encountered. After pursuing his Rock and Roll dreams in Germany and then in Boston, he eventually settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he founded his band Luna Negra. \r\n\r\nTheir album, Nouveau Flamenco, began life as a self-produced local release called Marita: Shadows and Storms, copies of which local Indian artist Frank Howell distributed in his art galleries. When the record found its way to radio stations and began generating a buzz among programmers and an unprecedented response among listeners, Higher Octave Music picked it up and released a fully remastered version.\r\n\r\n“I was honestly happy playing this music in hotels and restaurants in Santa Fe. But in one year I went from doing that to opening for Miles Davis. It was a pretty intense jump,” he recalls. “Most shocking for me was to realize how many different people from so many diverse cultures embraced it. I still get letters from fans in Europe, South-America, Australia, and Asia...it’s been a really gratifying experience.

Calhoun: High Places Make Me High","primCategory":"visual arts","primSubCategory":"galleries","secCategory":"","secSubCategory":"","locationName":"Sweet Branch","address":"455 F Street","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"My early desire to become a museum-quality artist guides me with an unwavering faith. With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together. Thanks so much for coming.","date":"October 14, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4764248e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5680/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"b588d85c56cf41af92b6c9321ea370fe","lat":"40.77999174887239","lng":"-111.87640967608685","__v":0}

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world? He lives in Salt Lake City.","date":"October 14, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4764248e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"cc275a61e2184bce8ef5d6f360d7651b","lat":"40.780624624397035","lng":"-111.89911056901481","__v":0}

Ballet West II was unveiled in 2004 and recently has toured the country to great success, this will be the first time they have had a dedicated program in Salt Lake City. The second company is comprised of pre-professionals from around the globe, and has been critically lauded for their physicality and diverse repertoire.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n“Ballet West II has established a reputation of its own as an elite touring ensemble,” said CEO and Artistic Director Adam Sklute. “The dancers are remarkably gifted; currently 25 dancers of Ballet West’s main Company have come out of Ballet West II including four of our Principals and five Soloists. Many others have gone on to dance with some of the most prestigious ballet companies in the world.” On a recent tour, the Cedar Rapids Gazette said, “Ballet West II’s eclectic program brought thrilling moments of the classical ballet tradition, as well as modern works by emerging choreographers and a little acid rock infused with plenty of attitude.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nSklute adds, “Director Calvin Kitten and Associate Director, Peggy Dolkas, have a deep and powerful knowledge of ballet and ballet training.” Kitten, a 19-year veteran of The Joffrey Ballet, has two Ruth Page Awards, and has been featured on the cover of Dance Magazine. He was Assistant Professor of Ballet at the University of Utah from 2010 to 2015. Dolkas was a beloved Soloist with Ballet West from 2003 to 2010. Prior to joining Ballet West II’s leadership staff, she was Ballet Mistress for Nevada Ballet Theater for three seasons. During their performing careers, both Kitten and Dolkas were named by Dance Magazine in their coveted list of “25 Dancers to Watch.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nAt the Rose Wagner, the troupe will perform a mixed bill of rarely seen classics and bold new works that will highlight the dancers impressive and diverse talents. The repertoire includes:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nEarly 19th Century Danish master August Bournonville’s Napoli Variations and Tarantella opens the program. This sunny, upbeat, and technically demanding piece showcases the strength, fast precise footwork, and charm of the entire Ballet West II troupe, and is a tribute to folk dances in Southern Italy.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBallet West II Associate Director Peggy Dolkas presents Are we there yet? A quirky and fascinating work that is set to a mix by DJ Robatroid for three couples. Dolkas has tooled this piece to feature the dancers’ unique fluidity and theatricality.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nMinkus Pas de Trois, with music from Ludwig Minkus, is a spellbinding re-staging after Marius Petipa’s ballet Paquita, originally choreographed in 1847. It is an elegant compilation for three dancers that shows off their pure and controlled classical technique and glamour.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nClosing the show is Ballet West Resident Choreographer Nicolo Fonte’s Piece of my Heart, a high-energy creation set to the music of Janis Joplin. The work unleashes the raw power and exuberance of Ballet West II’s young dancers with a rock and roll aesthetic.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBesides frequently presenting to sold-out audiences across the United States, Ballet West II also serves as a major component for Ballet West’s Outreach and Education initiatives. Last year alone, the various programs had the troupe performing in front of over 110,000 educators and students in Utah. For members of Ballet West II, this is an unprecedented opportunity to gain experience alongside the professional Company, while helping to further Ballet West’s commitment to community education and outreach.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBallet West II sold-out every location of its most recent tour, and with just three performances at the Rose Wagner, tickets will certainly sell out.

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 15, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4765688e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"683acb3d2e70494b979bc813a18b36a4","lat":"40.75655043125163","lng":"-111.9164673476162","__v":0}

She's toured with many of said artists as well as The Swell Season, Sara Bareilles, Amos Lee, Liz Phair, and more. Rachael was invited by the White House to take part in its Official White House 'Tweet Up' in the West Wing with fans, and was one of Chopra's music playlist selections featured on Oprah Winfrey's website.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nArtist/filmmaker/photographer Gregory Colbert, best known for his acclaimed project \"Ashes and Snow\" which, to date, is the most attended solo exhibition by any living artist in history, asked Rachael to be a guest vocalist on his upcoming project.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nRachael and John Medeski (Medeski Martin \u0026 Wood) covered director Robert Altman song 'Let's Begin Again' featured in the opening scene and end credits of the documentary, Altman (2014). Medeski said, \"Rachael blew my mind with her performance. She's a natural jazz singer.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nFans span the spectrum from 14-year-old girls to 65-year-old men, from spiritual healers, helicopter pilots, and military women, to hostage negotiators, heads of television networks, and single mothers. Rachael continually hears from fans that her music helped them through something in their life. Famed Korean photographer Jungman Kim calls Rachael 'his muse' and writer/journalist/ broadcaster Katherine Lanpher cites Rachael as the only twice invited guest of the Barnes \u0026 Nobel series, \"Upstairs at the Square\" (with novelist Alaa-Al-Aswany, \"The Yacoubian Building\" and Bill Clegg, \"Portrait of an Addict as a Young Man\" and \"90 Days\").\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nOn the business front, Rachael was a guest speaker at 2013 Chicago Ideas Week, and profiled in two separate Topspin Berklee School of Music marketing classes with her Pledge Music DIY campaigns being used as part of the course curriculum.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nRachael breaks the mold of the singer/songwriter stereotype, and the DIY indie-artist model as, for the past four years she has be working without management representation.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nCD releases to date include Heavyweight EP (2012), Noisetrade Mixtape (2012), Chesapeake (2011), Elephants (2008), Loose Ends EP (2007), Live at the Loft (2005), Happenstance (2004), and Rachael Yamagata: EP (2001).\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nHer latest album, currently titled 'Tightrope Walker,' is slated for a fall 2015 release. It showcases her calling card ability to articulate humanity's struggles within relationships and the freedom that comes from celebrating that which we face alone and head on. The production is riskier and cinematic – think Tom Waits meets Roberta Flack, Nick Cave hanging with Rufus Wainwright. Rachael confounds a labeled genre and instead embraces the production that serves the story. The paradox of her art mirrors that of her career and proves that we are never simplistic, but always full of surprises.\r\n\r\nPressing Strings\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nPressing Strings is a soul stirring trio based out of the musically fertile scene of Annapolis, Maryland. Their sound is versatile and stems from lead singer Jordan Sokel's soulful, bluesy songwriting combined with a solid and dynamic rhythm section. Anchored by drummer Brandon Bartlett and bassist Nick Welker, their musical influences span genres and generations. As a result their fan base does the same.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAll three members grew up basically on the Mason-Dixon line, in the shadow of Appalachia and sewn into the seems of the Chesapeake.

Set in seven different languages, each movement combines some characteristics of its language-group’s musical culture with the composer’s own musical language. Texts include Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Zulu, Spanish, and English.\r\n\r\nThis moving work features Carol Ann Allred, soprano; Demaree Clayson Brown, alto; Wenjing She, erhu; John Yerby, guitar, SLCA Concert Choir, Women’s Choir, Vocal Artists, and the SLCA Chamber Orchestra.\r\n\r\n“Gospel Mass” opens the second half of the evening’s performance.  “It is my desire to combine centuries of old traditions of Mass settings with sounds of the contemporary Black Church.  The move from Latin to English created new opportunities for composers to express their feelings about the texts of the Ordinary of the Mass. I wanted everyone to experience the sense of joy and celebration that is generally felt in true African-American worship”, states Robert Ray the composer.  Ray composed the piece in 1978 while Ray was a liturgy team leader for the National Office of Black Catholics. \r\n\r\nMaking her first appearance at the Libby Gardner Concert Hall, Roseanna Clark is thrilled to be working with the Salt Lake Choral Artists as soloist.

Calhoun: High Places Make Me High","primCategory":"visual arts","primSubCategory":"galleries","secCategory":"","secSubCategory":"","locationName":"Sweet Branch","address":"455 F Street","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"My early desire to become a museum-quality artist guides me with an unwavering faith. With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together.

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time.

The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world? He lives in Salt Lake City.","date":"October 15, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4765112e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"e3250ff27a5b4097836802110ffdb783","lat":"40.78055223209429","lng":"-111.89920679431094","__v":0}

Ballet West II was unveiled in 2004 and recently has toured the country to great success, this will be the first time they have had a dedicated program in Salt Lake City. The second company is comprised of pre-professionals from around the globe, and has been critically lauded for their physicality and diverse repertoire.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n“Ballet West II has established a reputation of its own as an elite touring ensemble,” said CEO and Artistic Director Adam Sklute. “The dancers are remarkably gifted; currently 25 dancers of Ballet West’s main Company have come out of Ballet West II including four of our Principals and five Soloists. Many others have gone on to dance with some of the most prestigious ballet companies in the world.” On a recent tour, the Cedar Rapids Gazette said, “Ballet West II’s eclectic program brought thrilling moments of the classical ballet tradition, as well as modern works by emerging choreographers and a little acid rock infused with plenty of attitude.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nSklute adds, “Director Calvin Kitten and Associate Director, Peggy Dolkas, have a deep and powerful knowledge of ballet and ballet training.” Kitten, a 19-year veteran of The Joffrey Ballet, has two Ruth Page Awards, and has been featured on the cover of Dance Magazine. He was Assistant Professor of Ballet at the University of Utah from 2010 to 2015. Dolkas was a beloved Soloist with Ballet West from 2003 to 2010. Prior to joining Ballet West II’s leadership staff, she was Ballet Mistress for Nevada Ballet Theater for three seasons. During their performing careers, both Kitten and Dolkas were named by Dance Magazine in their coveted list of “25 Dancers to Watch.”\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nAt the Rose Wagner, the troupe will perform a mixed bill of rarely seen classics and bold new works that will highlight the dancers impressive and diverse talents. The repertoire includes:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nEarly 19th Century Danish master August Bournonville’s Napoli Variations and Tarantella opens the program. This sunny, upbeat, and technically demanding piece showcases the strength, fast precise footwork, and charm of the entire Ballet West II troupe, and is a tribute to folk dances in Southern Italy.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBallet West II Associate Director Peggy Dolkas presents Are we there yet? A quirky and fascinating work that is set to a mix by DJ Robatroid for three couples. Dolkas has tooled this piece to feature the dancers’ unique fluidity and theatricality.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nMinkus Pas de Trois, with music from Ludwig Minkus, is a spellbinding re-staging after Marius Petipa’s ballet Paquita, originally choreographed in 1847. It is an elegant compilation for three dancers that shows off their pure and controlled classical technique and glamour.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nClosing the show is Ballet West Resident Choreographer Nicolo Fonte’s Piece of my Heart, a high-energy creation set to the music of Janis Joplin. The work unleashes the raw power and exuberance of Ballet West II’s young dancers with a rock and roll aesthetic.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBesides frequently presenting to sold-out audiences across the United States, Ballet West II also serves as a major component for Ballet West’s Outreach and Education initiatives. Last year alone, the various programs had the troupe performing in front of over 110,000 educators and students in Utah. For members of Ballet West II, this is an unprecedented opportunity to gain experience alongside the professional Company, while helping to further Ballet West’s commitment to community education and outreach.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBallet West II sold-out every location of its most recent tour, and with just three performances at the Rose Wagner, tickets will certainly sell out.

As the grandson of renowned film composer John Williams, his style is different than one might expect\\. Instead of being thick and orchestral, his improvised bedroom recordings are akin to the dreamy lo\\-fi of acts of Deerhunter and Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti\\. Williams started recording his debut in the spring of 2010, playing all of the instruments himself and building washy textures through multi\\-tracking\\. Soon after the album was completed, he employed a full band to tour behind Lemniscate, which was released on No Pain in Pop in 2012\\. While in Seoul, South Korea, Lionel met up with Toro y Moi's Chaz Bundick and the two soon decided to collaborate, with 2014's Trance Zen Dental Spa being the result\\. Bundick signed Vinyl Williams to his Company Records, and released the space rock\\- and shoegaze\\-influenced Into during July of 2015\\. His next album was recorded by Bundick and featured guitar work by Ian Gibbs and additional vocals and synth by Medicine's Brad Laner\\.

After his two previous studio albums (\"151a\" \u0026 \"Lighght\"), Kishi Bashi was at a musical impasse. “As I sat down to write songs last summer, I went to all my usual conduits of creation: violin loops, guitar, piano, and I came up with the musical equivalent of fumes”, says K Ishibashi. “I tried to create orchestral pop recordings that I assumed were my forte, and in turn I found myself standing in front of a creative wall of frightening heights.” \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAt this very same moment of musical uncertainty, K’s personal life was falling apart… He and his wife of 13 years had briefly separated and were struggling to keep their marriage together. In his own words, “Touring and its accompanying lifestyle took a heavy toll on my soul and my family”. As an outlet, K submerged himself in a new musical direction. \"Sonderlust\" emerged as a direct result of this personal struggle taking place at an artistic crossroads. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nWith the help of producer Chris Taylor (Grizzly Bear), engineer Pat Dillet (Angelique Kidjo, David Byrne) and drummer Matt Chamberlain (Morrissey, Fiona Apple, of Montreal), Kishi Bashi has created his most personal and artistically adventurous work to date. “This album is straight from my soul. I questioned everything about what it means to love and desire. The difference between loving someone and being in love.”\r\n\r\nBusman's Holiday\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nBusman's Holiday is a two person band blending the melodic charm of lo-fi acoustics with the ecstatic showmanship of classic rock 'n' roll. The singer/songwriter duo is accompanied by a string section who fill out their complexly euphonic ballads of love, loss, lust and outer space. Born and raised in Bloomington, Indiana, the pair and their intrepid band of string playing companions have toured the U.S. and Canada extensively the past three years, recently appearing on Day Trotter and If You Make It's Pink Couch Sessions. \r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThough adept in a D.I.Y. aesthetic of acoustic busking with only a guitar and a suitcase drum set, the brothers are equally at home when sharing the stage with their three talented string players, who add a rich, layered musical texture to their unique songs of wanderlust and first love. Evoking a classic tent-show rock sound joined with the affable atmosphere of the assured vaudevillian, Busman's Holiday both charms and impresses with their own unique blend of humor and assured musical talent.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nThis event is 21 and over","date":"October 16, 2016","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.476666e+12,"url":"http://www.theurbanloungeslc.com/event/1246967-kishi-bashi-salt-lake-city/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"96da276baf9849bd93c3b4bae2e2c9cd","lat":"40.76380837280895","lng":"-111.87585957444342","__v":0}

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world?

In *Cantando na chuva*,* *Reale is unrecognizable in a gold suit complete with a gold gas mask and a gold umbrella as she dances to the title song of the 1952 Hollywood classic *Singing in the Rain. *Dancing through a landfill among the *catadores*(pickers)* *who routinely sift through the piles of trash in the background, Reale presents a contrast** **between the backbreaking actions* *of the workers** **and the frivolous nature of a material-obsessed world.

Years later Bradford met Moses Archuleta and started jamming together. Other contributors to Deerhunter since its establishment in 2001 include Josh Fauver, Colin Mee and Whitney Petty. The current incarnation consists of Cox, Pundt and Archuleta plus bassist Josh Mckay and guitarist Frankie Broyles.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nDeerhunter's first album was a lo-fi experiment not initially intended for the wider world, but appeared in 2005 on a local Atlanta label, Stickfigure. Although officially untitled, it has since become known as Turn It Up, Faggot; a phrase that doesn't actually appear on the sleeve but is an insult that Cox claimed was often thrown at the band during their early gigs. Their next album, Cryptograms (2006), was generally considered to be their real debut and as such things started to get serious for the band. They had moved to fêted Chicago indie, Kranky (Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Low, Stars Of The Lid), and the world outside was starting to pay attention.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThen in mid-2008, Deerhunter and Kranky signed a deal with 4AD, allowing them to finally release music outside the US and the band's next move was to prove epic in more than just musical terms.?? Recorded over the course of a week at the Rare Book Studios in Brooklyn, NY, the Can and Wire-inspired Microcastle (2008) was to propel them to further heights. However, the album leaked four months before release, leading the band back to the studio to record Weird Era Cont., an album in its own right added as a bonus disc to make Microcastle a 25-track colossus. Not content with such prolificacy, the band announced a new five track EP, Rainwater Cassette Exchange, in 2009 and that its release would coincide with the band's extensive European, Japanese and Australian tour in May and June.??\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nDisplaying few signs of slowing down, Halcyon Digest, the band's fourth studio album was released in September 2010. Remaining in their native Georgia to piece together the album, Halcyon Digest took just a few weeks to complete. The recording sessions took place at Chase Park Transduction in Athens with Ben H. Allen helping to co-produce the album, while final track, 'He Would Have Laughed', was recorded separately by Bradford Cox at NOTOWN SOUND in Marietta. To announce the release, the band fully embraced the DIY mindset of their New Wave heroes from the 70's and 80's with a Cox-designed, cut-and-paste Xeroxed flyer. It's with these kind of approaches that Deerhunter continue to widen their sphere of influence and impress with each subsequent release.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAfter a brief hiatus, during which time Bradford Cox and Lockett Pundt released their own albums as Atlas Sound and Lotus Plaza respectively, a new Deerhunter line-up (with additions of bassist Josh Mckay and guitarist Frankie Broyles) reconvened in January 2013 at Rare Book Studio in Brooklyn, New York. Produced by Nicholas Vernhes and Bradford Cox and recorded in the dead of night, Deerhunter's new longplayer Monomania will be released in May. Monomania finds the group recalling its scrappy punk aesthetic; a perfect nocturnal garage rock album full of the layered and hazy vintage guitar sounds that define them.\r\n\r\nAldous Harding\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n\r\nAldous Harding's music is not for the faint of heart. Disarming in its desolate imagery and stark instrumentation, it deals with the raw materials of life: death, birth, grief and love. There are few happy endings, but the power is in how Harding enters into battle; with a dancer's grace and a boxer's stance.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nSometimes reminiscent of 60s-era folk singers Vashti Bunyan and Linda Perhacs, Harding's work lies in more harsh terrain than her forebears – piercing the long history of the genre with a grit and sincerity rarely encountered. Somewhat out of step with the 21st Century, Aldous' music is accompanied by wry wit and tenacious gall that will see her become a true stayer in the music world.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nHailing from New Zealand's Southern port town of Lyttelton, Aldous has received attention and accolades from some of the most illustrious corners of the music industry. Her self-titled debut album received 4 stars in MOJO and Uncut, while UK blog The 405 hailed her a \"toweringly talented song writer.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"Compelling, gothic-folk first from NZ newcomer.\" – UNCUT (four stars)\r\n___\r\n\"Soft chanting and singing saws add mystery to a beguiling debut.\" – MOJO (four stars)\r\n___\r\n\"Harding wrestles every last drop of macabre intent.\" – Silent Radio (10 out of 11)","date":"October 17, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.476756e+12,"url":"http://www.theurbanloungeslc.com/event/1255741-deerhunter-salt-lake-city/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"a14028f07a934078b0c8ecabb217b4ab","lat":"40.763750426833994","lng":"-111.87587504458254","__v":0}

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes.
