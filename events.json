It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 7, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4758776e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"6857319ebfa4483d8c64ee5a804d9763","lat":"40.75653811256549","lng":"-111.91642650734185","__v":0}

With hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, Orny is regarded by his peers as one of the hardest working and passionate comedians in the business. Orny first rose to international prominence after Jerry Seinfeld chose him to co-star in his documentary “Comedian.” He has made several appearances on The Tonight Show and appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman. Orny’s debut DVD “Path Of Most Resistance,” was critically acclaimed and was available on Netflix. That was followed by a powerful and poignant one hour special “Orny Adams Takes The Third” which aired on Comedy Central and Netflix. Currently, and for the past six seasons, Orny can be seen playing the iconic role “Coach Finstock” on the hit MTV show “Teen Wolf,” a one hour drama created by Criminal Mind’s Jeff Davis. Jeff handpicked Orny for the role after seeing him perform at the Hollywood Improv.\r\n\r\nEarly in his career Orny was named in The Hollywood Reporter as a favorite comedian to watch. He has written jokes for Jay Leno, Garry Shandling, and many other top comedians. He has twice written for the Annual Emmys Broadcast and has become the “go to” guy when a celebrity needs a funny line. In July 2000, Orny made quite an impact at the Montreal Comedy Festival, which resulted in a development deal with Warner Brothers Studio, and his appearance on Letterman. In 2010, Orny was thrilled to return to the festival in Montreal working alongside one of his favorite comedians Steve Martin on a taped televised stand up show Martin hosted. Orny garnered rave reviews for his performance and was called a “Stand-out act” by The Hollywood Reporter.\r\n\r\nOther notable projects include a talk show pilot developed for Orny by CBS Television Distribution/Kingworld along side Ashton Kutcher’s Katalyst Films. Orny shot another pilot for his own late night talk show for TBS and taped his own series, “Modern Chaos with Orny Adams” for The Discovery Channel. He hosted his own show on Discovery’s Travel Channel, has appeared on Jiminy Glick, Tough Crowd on Comedy Central, The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, Last Call With Carson Daly, and did a regular segment on Hollywood and politics on Entertainment Tonight and The Insider. You may also recognize him from other notable television appearances and many of his national commercials, including Coca-Cola. Orny made his first TV appearance in 1996 on Friday Night Videos.\r\n\r\nWhen not performing stand-up, Orny spends his days writing, penning scripts, and developing television shows. A few years back, he struck a deal with Endimol for “The Pitch,” a reality show he conceived.\r\n\r\nBut none of this matters until you see Orny live where he is at his best, deconstructing the chaos of the modern world and getting energized about things that most people just accept. His tour has reached clubs, theatres, even the Staples Center in LA, colleges, corporate events, and festivals as far away as Ireland, Australia, and South Africa. Orny’s comedy style is unique, yet universally appealing. Orny is quick on his feet to deliver a powerful, clever, sophisticated, and fast paced routine that pounds topics from an angle that many people have never considered.","date":"October 7, 2016","startTime":"19:30","endTime":"21:30","timeValue":1.4758902e+12,"url":"http://www.wiseguyscomedy.com/event/554/orny-adams","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"969997aea0044e9aac37b28cb15957d4","lat":"40.7649218","lng":"-111.9026533","__v":0}

I personally looked to artists like Springsteen, 70's Bowie, The Smiths, The Cure, Neil Young as inspiration for—not really for sound as much as for that dichotomy of bands who were entertainers still making, at times, weird dark music and writing songs that seem totally over-the-top by today's rock band standards,\" says Cymbals Eat Guitars bassist Matthew Whipple of his band's wildly ambitious fourth LP, Pretty Years.\r\n___\r\nThe band, composed of singer/guitarist Joseph D'Agostino, bassist Whipple, keyboardist Brian Hamilton, and drummer Andy Dole, have indeed crafted what's easily their most sonically enigmatic and most rewarding album to date. Their trademark cacophonic guitar rock and innate propulsion are still abundant, but they're buttressed by raucous synth and keyboard lines, and an extemporaneous saxophone performance, which enrich when they could easily clutter these songs. The band also worked more quickly and efficiently than they had in the past, facilitated by years on the road in which they've played close to a thousand shows, which rendered them a tight, fully-oiled machine in the studio.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nD'Agostino emphasizes that the band always goes into the studio with an edict of crafting an album that replicates their live sound, but haven't had that come into full fruition until now. \"With this record...I think we nailed it this time. First or second takes of everything, real hunger in the performances. Just something to prove.\" He stresses that he'd be happy with the band's chaotic yet tight performances on songs, yet would expect producer John Congleton to ask him to do multiple run throughs. To his surprise, Congleton would say pithily, in D'Agostino's words, \"ok, what's next?,\" obviously satisfied with the results. Remarkably, the band tracked the album in four days.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThis looseness is apparent from the outset, on the epic grandeur of opener \"Finally,\" which shimmers with complex beauty, leading into the sweet rush of \"Have a Heart,\" which finds D'Agostino singing, \"I'm so out of sync / And you're out of sync with me,\" which could well be a mantra for the visceral appeal of this superb record.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nThe entire album is rife with electrified, flashbulb moments—\"4th of July, Philadelphia (SANDY)\" conveys the madness of life on the road, exhibiting D'Agostino's uncanny ability to transform minutiae into profundity. This skill is evident in spades on the record's centerpiece and opus, the disarmingly vulnerable \"Dancing Days.\" The song also exhibits the contributions of Whipple, and slyly invokes the album's title in its magisterial chorus, as D'Agostino contritely croons, \"Goodbye to my pretty years.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\n\"In a dark moment on tour for LOSE, I said something to Matt about losing my pretty years quickly because of touring, how the lifestyle ages you,\" explains D'Agostino. \"Months later when we were writing for the record, he came to me with the lyrics for that chorus and I wrote the song around them.\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nD'Agostino gets to the crux of his emotions on the album's closer, \"Shrine,\" in which he veers from the ghosts chasing him into fever dream territory, seemingly coming to terms with demons past. The instrumentation itself is a gorgeous storm-cloud of guitars, building glacially to a cathartic denouement, as D'agostino sings with mounting emotion, \"Where will it all go when I die / Never know while I'm alive.\" Circumspect about discussing his lyrics' meanings, D'Agostino laughs when the dark nature of the song's broached, \"This is a record that has many moods!\"\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nAnd indeed, Pretty Years is a roller coaster ride, both lyrically and sonically, that encompasses what it's like to be alive and in the moment. But ultimately, this is an album that keenly captures the magic and loss attendant to living life wide-eyed, and hints that these \"pretty years\" may portend even prettier ones to come.\r\n\r\nField Mouse\r\n\r\nTwitter\r\n\r\nFacebook\r\n\r\nWebsite\r\n\r\nA make-your-own CD recording booth was privy to Rachel Browne's first recording in 1999, a cover of No Doubt's \"Just a Girl\". It would be another many years before she enrolled at SUNY Purchase, where she majored in music composition and met Andrew Futral, a producer and musician. The two began collaborating musically and in 2010 Field Mouse was officially formed.\r\n___\r\nIf 2014's 'Hold Still' Life was the fruition of Field Mouse's evolution from a fiery two-piece into a fully-fledged band, then new album Episodic (August 5, Topshelf Records) is the letting go; the abandonment of past persuasions for something altogether more untamed. Where the band's initial work was self-recorded by founding members Rachel Browne and Andrew Futral, the new record signifies the first time that the quintet has composed an album together from start-to-finish - and the result is a record that feels altogether more defined.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nRecorded in Philadelphia with Hop Along's Joe Reinhart, and written through a twelve month period which delivered sudden family illness and a deteriorating relationship, 'Episodic' is fashioned from ten feverish bouts of guitar-pop; led by Browne's fearsome and fearless vocal and informed by an instrumental backing that underpins the entire record with a vibrant concoction of guitar, drums and keys.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nShowcasing the band's ability to switch between mood and tone, the record shifts from the spiky immediacy of tracks such as \"Accessory\" and \"A Widow with a Terrible Secret\", to the more spacious moments, such as monumental center-piece \"Beacon\", without ever losing sight of the scuzzy, melodic pop songs that remain Field Mouse's distinct forte.\r\n___\r\n\r\n___\r\nFeaturing guest turns from Sadie Dupuis (Speedy Ortiz), Allison Crutchfield (Swearin'/Waxahatchee) and Joseph D'Agostino (Cymbals Eat Guitars), Episodic is the sound of a fully-realized band truly coming in to their own; honest, direct and immensely powerful.\r\n\r\nWildhoney\r\n\r\nTwitter\r\n\r\nFacebook\r\n\r\nWebsite\r\n\r\nWildhoney formed in late 2011, aiming to write pop songs with the energy and malcontent of hardcore punk, but without its entrenched masculinity. The five-piece has since become one of the loudest—and sweetest—bands in its hometown of Baltimore.\r\n___\r\n'Sleep Through It' expands on two excellent 7-inches and one cassette EP, drawing influences from '60s girl groups, '80s post punk, indie pop, and shoegaze. Throughout the album, the group's blasts of distortion and use of dense textures are balanced with beautiful pop tunes and chiming guitar work. Sleep Through It was recorded at Beat Babies Studio in Woodstock, Md., with Chris Freeland (Lower Dens, Wye Oak).","date":"October 7, 2016","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.475892e+12,"url":"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1231541-cymbals-eat-guitars-salt-lake-city/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"abf261c8dc8845f4a3e7ab8677fc62bb","lat":"40.76713170000001","lng":"-111.9089746","__v":0}

The classes use a classical method to teach the fundamentals of drawing, painting, color, design, and more. There are only six students allowed per class, and this small-group format makes for a fun, innovative, and semi-private art instruction experience. These classes help children develop artistic skills while nurturing imagination, and are a great way to enhance their creative ability and self-confidence. The goal is to cultivate the children’s visual awareness and expand aesthetic senses.\r\n\r\nThrough the process of creating a harmonious image, Fahimeh’s students learn the principles of rhythm, balance, variety, and motion. The realistic approach of this work requires the students to pay attention to light and shadow, color and value, and texture and proportion, as well as develop a strong aesthetic sense for composition. Every piece is designed to capture the very character of its subject.\r\n\r\nThis annual exhibition has gained popularity due to the quality of the artwork displayed by participating children. Their exciting work has captivated viewers from all around the valley. Not only is the exhibition itself visually enchanting for viewers, it’s exciting for the children as well; they gain a sense of accomplishment.","date":"October 7, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.47582e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.org/events/view/5587/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"11c6feb2556243de980749fe1907ea9c","lat":"40.76007056214573","lng":"-111.8847612091453","__v":0}

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes. His main interest lies in asking these persistent questions: Who are we as humans? How do we relate to the rest of the world? He lives in Salt Lake City.","date":"October 7, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.47582e+12,"url":"","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"6df960f0c21a4568a80956ce94fd1b44","lat":"40.78050374825382","lng":"-111.89918473186083","__v":0}

After traveling around the world, she settled just below the same mountain range in Salt Lake City, where she currently lives and works. Her inclination toward art started early and followed her throughout her college career where she studied Art Education and Psychology.\r\n\r\nDesarae held her first gallery exhibition at Kayo Gallery in 2012 and participated in her first Utah Arts Festival two months later, growing and solidifying a loyal fan base that continues to expand to this day. In 2015, Desarae’s art was shown at more than twenty-five arts festivals and art galleries in the United States. She has won awards including Best Illustrator (*Salt Lake City Weekly*), Best of Show (Tempe Festival of the Arts) and Featured Artist (ArtWalk San Diego). She is currently working with two publishers on three different art book projects and building a printmaking studio after running a successful Kickstarter campaign.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by personal trauma and struggles with depression and anxiety disorders, Desarae creates work that revolves around themes of finding humor in pain, beauty in the grotesque, and light in the darkness. As comfortable referencing geek culture as she is bearing the depths of her soul, Desarae’s work ranges in theme but is always, as she says, “an attempt to connect the hidden places in myself to the hidden places in the viewer, to somehow create a bridge of communication over the immense expanse of our differing perceptions, beliefs, and experiences.”\r\n\r\nDesarae’s technique revolves around using lines to create value and texture. Working primarily with pen and ink, Desarae balances exact, meticulous line-work with natural, flowing compositions. Over time, her work has developed to include watercolor, tea-staining, and print-making. This shift results in more organic drawings that still maintain her original intricacy. It is within this juxtaposition of controlled pen and unpredictable watercolor that Desarae finds her voice. Desarae’s work begs you to understand her innermost being and through that gives you the courage to examine your own.","date":"October 7, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.47582e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5588/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"fc50df03d19d4281a754e5912fb6c20f","lat":"40.76017533483402","lng":"-111.88480996987295","__v":0}

Calhoun: High Places Make Me High","primCategory":"visual arts","primSubCategory":"galleries","secCategory":"","secSubCategory":"","locationName":"Sweet Branch","address":"455 F Street","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"My early desire to become a museum-quality artist guides me with an unwavering faith. With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together. Thanks so much for coming.","date":"October 7, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.47582e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5680/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"1a681bab989949899202e36d7868efb7","lat":"40.77990823422793","lng":"-111.87652433019957","__v":0}

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 9, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4760504e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"f348205194ef4a7385f67132f39e4be9","lat":"40.75672673142016","lng":"-111.91631756024167","__v":0}

Calhoun: High Places Make Me High","primCategory":"visual arts","primSubCategory":"galleries","secCategory":"","secSubCategory":"","locationName":"Sweet Branch","address":"455 F Street","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","description":"My early desire to become a museum-quality artist guides me with an unwavering faith. With all the negative, sometimes horrific events that happen in our world today, I am proud to have chosen to immerse myself in beauty and to share those experiences through my art. I am constantly setting a variety of mini goals that push me toward more artistic understanding, more growth. Through these explorations, I hope to provide tangible, visual reminders of the vast wealth of our natural world.\r\n\r\nThis show has an assortment of *plein air* (painting on location) and studio work that depicts my favorite, mountain places. In my first introduction to Alta, I felt as if I was experiencing the words in a song written by John Denver, “... coming home to a place I'd never been before.” This was a new feeling, a new awareness to me. I listened to that feeling, trusted in it, and moved here to see where it would take me. I am so grateful that I did. Our mountains lift me up physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They truly make my heart soar.\r\n\r\nYes, you'll see a lot of paintings of Mount Superior. I believe that \"her\" beautiful face is what first triggered the artistic urge within. I love how \"she\" changes with the various seasons. Her beautiful winter veil can—in a moment—send snow avalanching down, piling up on the main road. As spring heats up, she sheds that white veil to reveal her butterfly. Such a lovely patch of snow. Down to her bare bones in the summer, she reigns gently, yet mightily over the multitude of wildflower carpets below. Fall finds her hunkered down in shadow as if to allow all attention to be directed at the golden aspen trees. I can never get enough of these fascinating changes.\r\n\r\nDevil's Castle has much the same effect upon me.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years I set my paints and hikes aside. My parents were aging and I knew that they would not always be there (except in my heart and mind). They were fun and easy to help. Now, I am back painting and experiencing this world. I hope that your experience of *High Places Make Me High* will quietly bring us a little closer together. Thanks so much for coming.","date":"October 9, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4759928e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5680/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"561fc05b24da4c2b8ad9e75f0ba3aa20","lat":"40.77993288391742","lng":"-111.87647064916143","__v":0}

The classes use a classical method to teach the fundamentals of drawing, painting, color, design, and more. There are only six students allowed per class, and this small-group format makes for a fun, innovative, and semi-private art instruction experience. These classes help children develop artistic skills while nurturing imagination, and are a great way to enhance their creative ability and self-confidence. The goal is to cultivate the children’s visual awareness and expand aesthetic senses.\r\n\r\nThrough the process of creating a harmonious image, Fahimeh’s students learn the principles of rhythm, balance, variety, and motion. The realistic approach of this work requires the students to pay attention to light and shadow, color and value, and texture and proportion, as well as develop a strong aesthetic sense for composition. Every piece is designed to capture the very character of its subject.\r\n\r\nThis annual exhibition has gained popularity due to the quality of the artwork displayed by participating children.

After traveling around the world, she settled just below the same mountain range in Salt Lake City, where she currently lives and works. Her inclination toward art started early and followed her throughout her college career where she studied Art Education and Psychology.\r\n\r\nDesarae held her first gallery exhibition at Kayo Gallery in 2012 and participated in her first Utah Arts Festival two months later, growing and solidifying a loyal fan base that continues to expand to this day. In 2015, Desarae’s art was shown at more than twenty-five arts festivals and art galleries in the United States. She has won awards including Best Illustrator (*Salt Lake City Weekly*), Best of Show (Tempe Festival of the Arts) and Featured Artist (ArtWalk San Diego). She is currently working with two publishers on three different art book projects and building a printmaking studio after running a successful Kickstarter campaign.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by personal trauma and struggles with depression and anxiety disorders, Desarae creates work that revolves around themes of finding humor in pain, beauty in the grotesque, and light in the darkness. As comfortable referencing geek culture as she is bearing the depths of her soul, Desarae’s work ranges in theme but is always, as she says, “an attempt to connect the hidden places in myself to the hidden places in the viewer, to somehow create a bridge of communication over the immense expanse of our differing perceptions, beliefs, and experiences.”\r\n\r\nDesarae’s technique revolves around using lines to create value and texture. Working primarily with pen and ink, Desarae balances exact, meticulous line-work with natural, flowing compositions. Over time, her work has developed to include watercolor, tea-staining, and print-making. This shift results in more organic drawings that still maintain her original intricacy. It is within this juxtaposition of controlled pen and unpredictable watercolor that Desarae finds her voice. Desarae’s work begs you to understand her innermost being and through that gives you the courage to examine your own.","date":"October 9, 2016","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"","timeValue":1.4759928e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5588/","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"75f8da13c8ed408a9dfcf0281bda7c97","lat":"40.760115019226824","lng":"-111.8847734795598","__v":0}

The landscape is both a place and a viewer at the same time. It has its own experiences and asks its own questions, but these experiences and questions can easily be exchanged with those of the viewer.\r\n\r\nIn the form of self, these paintings show places in transition that the viewer can relate to their own life's transitions. This is why the landscape is a liminal place, where it is unclear if it is night or day and where the sky and earth are sharing certain elements. The water cycle, the geological cycle, and the life cycle take place in one image. The impression is given that the land is experiencing everything in a shortened time span, as if a million years were condensed into one moment and as if that experience were no different from the experience a human has in one lifetime. In this way, the viewer can be reminded of their inevitable transition from nonexistence to existence and back again.\r\n\r\nIt is not lost on the viewer that the images have been gathered in the Western United States. This does not fail to be important either. In the Colorado Plateau and Utah's West Desert, the infinite almost seems tangible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to suggest that there are personalities inherent in the land that are created by both natural and human events. These events linger just like traumas and joys linger in humans. I intend for these paintings to reveal these events so they appear as they are: playing on repeat forever.\r\n\r\n**\r\n___\r\n**\r\n\r\n**ARTIST BIOGRAPHY**\r\n___\r\nBen Kilbourne is a musician, painter, and intermedia artist from Southern Utah. His work is often built out of the landscapes of the West (particularly the Colorado Plateau) but it expresses much broader themes.

It would be easy for me to edit out all that is meaningful in my paintings by judging an inspiration as too sentimental, too complicated, or just plain crazy. Wrestling with my inner voices, both angels and demons, I struggle to create a personal visual language.\r\n\r\nPainting affirms my love of the messy tactile world, the world of color and surfaces. The paint becomes my micro-universe where I play with textures, rhythms of line and patterns of form, and, more importantly, the duality of creation and destruction. I layer the paint and collage to create real depth on the pictorial surface. Primitive art inspires my work in its disregard for anatomical correctness and illusionary effects of perspective. An Egyptian frontal view of the shoulders, an Aboriginal dot, an Assyrian eye facing forward in a facial profile, and an Anasazi headdress can all be found in my work. Much inspiration comes from the work of Paul Klee, Picasso, and Chagall who were each inspired, like me, by primitive art.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of my work sometimes reflects experiences my life with my family and animals, but they can also be a reflection of the inner journeys of my mind. This messy humanness I share with all the people who have come before me and who will come after me fuels my artistic engine. Through deceptively simple images and rich layering of texture, I intend for my paintings to speak beyond culture, time, and location. Employing a personal symbolic language, my paintings are the vehicle in my search for wholeness and connection.","date":"October 10, 2016","startTime":"16:00","endTime":"17:00","timeValue":1.4761368e+12,"url":"http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/events/view/5615/","host":"","contactNumber":"(801) 594-8623, (801) 524-8200","cwId":"ea6c88902ca34a60a5e6f8b87c3bf8d7","lat":"40.75667630416217","lng":"-111.91643230112244","__v":0}

I didn’t plan to make it and initially wasn’t sure if it was going to be an Okkervil River album or if I’d ever put it out. I wrote the songs during a confusing time of transition in my personal and professional life and recorded them quickly with a brand new group of musicians. I got together the best New York players I could think of, people whose playing and personalities I was fans of and who came more out of a jazz or avant garde background, and we cut the songs live in one or two takes – trying to keep things as natural and immediate as possible – over three days in a studio on Long Island that hosts the Neve 8068 console which recorded Steely Dan’s Aja and John Lennon’s Double Fantasy.

When Frank's lies catch the attention of FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, though, Carl pursues Frank across the country to make him pay for his crimes.","date":"October 10, 2016","startTime":"19:30","endTime":"21:30","timeValue":1.4761494e+12,"url":"http://webticketing.haletheater.org/showdates.php?s_id=363","host":"","contactNumber":"","cwId":"ea2fe560ec16440d9ef1365c65d67823","lat":"40.30413413668528","lng":"-111.70094390844721","__v":0}
